# obs-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-hyprland-seam — picked 279 of 1058 (151 by every draw) · rule any · pin 1006

## 1-obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin obs-scope-summary
decision/agents-probe-output-untrusted · Agents probe output untrusted — The output rows of the claude agents --json probe are untrusted.
decision/agents-probe-parse-failure-unknown · Agents probe parse failure becomes unknown — A parse failure of the claude agents --json probe becomes status "unknown" plus a parse-rejected counter; an unparsed --version answer leaves cli_version absent and the version unverified.
decision/child-exit-from-process-handle · Child exit from the process handle — The wrapped child's exit and its process-exit event come from the wait on the process handle, never from reader EOF.
decision/obs-deps-tokio-free · Obs dependencies Tokio-free and C-free — Obs dependencies stay Tokio-free in the sync crates, add no C-building crates and pass cargo deny. · guard: cargo deny
decision/os-apis-at-call-sites · OS APIs observed at call sites — OS APIs (openpty, Unix socket, filesystem locks and atomic rename, sysinfo) are instrumented at viola's call sites only, never in the OS internals.
decision/parse-failures-unknown-counter · Parse failures surface as unknown plus a counter — A child-output parse failure surfaces as `unknown` plus a counter.
decision/spans-not-wire-contract · Tracing spans are not part of the wire contract — Span names are internal `tracing` spans in `<area>.<operation>` snake_case form; the agent-facing contract is the closed `event` enum plus `corr`. · why: the config sets `with_current_span(false)`, so spans do not reach the line
contract/mcp-stdin/max-frame · viola mcp stdin · MAX_FRAME — Stdin is read in lines of at most `MAX_FRAME`; a longer line is refused whole and the session ends as at a closed stdin.
contract/process-exit-detail/socket-dir-refused · process-exit detail codes · socket-dir-refused — Carried by the line of a refused socket directory, where it has one; a refused socket directory is no strict-modes failure.
decision/absolute-paths-scrubbed-externally · Absolute paths scrubbed from external output — Absolute paths in snapshot.json (endpoint, pinned_bin) and in config values are scrubbed from external output and allowed in diagnostics/.
decision/cli-file-sink-only · Short-lived CLI logs to a file sink only — Short-lived CLI verbs log only to a JSON-per-line file sink in diagnostics when an instance resolves, never to stdout. · why: Stdout carries the --json results.
decision/diag-schema-additive-only · Diagnostic log schema is additive only — The log format JSON schema is binding: observability may add fields or extend the event enum through a Decisions Log entry, and must not rename or remove any field.
decision/error-chain-fixed-stderr-message · Error chains reach stderr as fixed messages — In the viola root binary, the only crate that uses anyhow, an error chain that contains a serde source becomes a fixed message before it reaches stderr, and the full chain goes to the diagnostics logs only.
decision/no-env-log-levels · No per-module log levels from the environment — Per-module log levels are never read from environment variables. · why: Environment variables are not a configuration channel.
decision/redaction-not-disableable · Redaction cannot be disabled — No verbosity control, env, flag or config may disable or bypass redaction.
decision/refusal-telemetry · Refusal telemetry for filesystem refusals — Pinned-exe hash mismatches and ignored symlinks produce refusal telemetry.
decision/serde-errors-fixed-message · Serde error chains become a fixed message — A serde-sourced anyhow error chain is replaced by a fixed message before it reaches stderr.
decision/stderr-fixed-strings · Fixed strings on stderr — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/tracing-json-line-file-pipeline · tracing JSON-per-line file pipeline — Telemetry is tracing plus tracing-subscriber writing JSON-per-line files under diagnostics/, correlated by corr and consumed through agent-run logs and status. · why: The pipeline is the one the tests plan binds.
decision/tracing-json-pipeline · tracing with the tracing-subscriber JSON formatter — The `tracing` facade plus the tracing-subscriber JSON formatter is the binding logging pipeline, and JSON-to-file is the only logging mode.
contract/diag-line/instance · diagnostic log line · instance — The instance's `ViolaName`; the key is absent when the process has no instance.
contract/diagnostics-files/cli · the diagnostics files · cli — Role cli writes <home>/diagnostics/cli-<name>.ndjson, only when an instance resolves.

## obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin 1-obs-scope-summary
decision/agents-cli-output-untrusted · claude agents output untrusted — The output rows of `claude agents --json` are treated as untrusted.
decision/agents-cli-parse-failure-unknown · claude agents parse failure reads unknown — A failed parse of `claude agents --json` output reads "unknown" plus a counter.
decision/child-exit-from-handle-wait · Child exit from the process handle — The child's process-exit comes from the wait on its process handle, never from reader end-of-file. · why: Child exit is detected on the process handle.
decision/detail-codes-no-paths · Detail codes carry no path or pid — No path or pid appears in a detail code.
decision/fixed-stderr-messages · Fixed stderr refusal and fault lines — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/fixtures-not-telemetry · Recorded fixtures are no telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are scrub-required data, not a telemetry source, and are excluded from the observability plan. · why: Not product runtime.
decision/instrument-call-sites-not-os-internals · OS operations instrumented at viola's call sites — OS-level operations (bind, connect, lock, rename, kill fallback, the server check's peer reads, the strict-modes stat reads, the socket directory check) are instrumented at viola's own call sites, not inside the OS.
decision/linux-only-os-target · Linux-only OS target — The OS target is Linux only: the core on any current distribution, CI on ubuntu-latest.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen · No telemetry from screen content — No telemetry is derived from screen content; vt100 serves gate outcomes only.
decision/obs-deps-no-c-building-crates · Obs dependencies build no C — Observability dependencies add no C-building crates.
decision/obs-deps-pass-cargo-deny · Obs dependencies pass cargo deny — Observability dependencies pass cargo deny on its one target, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. · guard: cargo deny
decision/parse-failures-surface-as-unknown · Parse failures surface as unknown — A parse failure surfaces as the value unknown plus a counter.
decision/per-parser-parse-failure-counts · Per-parser parse-failure counts — Each parser that drops input (channel framing at MAX_FRAME, the viola mcp stdin at MAX_FRAME, hook stdin, claude agents --json, vt100 under catch_unwind) keeps its own parse-failure count; paste validation refuses a send as not-delivered instead.
decision/serde-chain-fixed-message · Serde error chains become a fixed message on stderr — An error chain that contains a serde source becomes a fixed message before it reaches stderr.
decision/serde-errors-become-fixed-message · Serde errors become a fixed message — An error chain holding a serde source is replaced by a fixed message before it reaches stderr.
decision/socket-dir-one-code · One code for socket-directory causes — A refused check, a failed create or a lost race on the socket directory all read the one code socket-dir-refused.
decision/sync-instrumentation-no-tokio · Sync instrumentation without Tokio — Instrumentation in the sync crates runs on std threads with no Tokio. · why: Hybrid concurrency. · guard: cargo deny ban
contract/process-log-corr/process-exit · Process log corr by event · process-exit — corr is null.
contract/process-log-corr/process-start · Process log corr by event · process-start — corr is null.
contract/process-log/event · Process log line · event — A closed kebab-case enum; a new value needs a Decisions Log entry, and each value fixes what its corr holds.
decision/agents-cli-instrumented-at-boundary · claude agents CLI instrumented at spawn, exit and parse — The external `claude agents --json` CLI is instrumented only at its spawn, its exit and its parse outcome. · why: An external CLI.
decision/anyhow-error-capture-boundary · The anyhow crate is the error-capture boundary — The only crate that uses anyhow is the error-capture boundary, with context chains only at dispatch; the full chain goes to diagnostics only.
decision/fault-telemetry-per-class · Fault telemetry per class — Each fault class emits its own telemetry: a healed torn ndjson line with file and offset, a corrupt or unsupported snapshot recovered by replay, a child exit seen without EOF, an endpoint vanished during wait, and a stale heartbeat against a live pid.
decision/latency-aggregation-outside-process · Latency aggregation outside the process — Percentile aggregation is done by the harness or jq over the ndjson, never by an in-process metrics pipeline.
decision/log-fields-additive-only · Required log fields only added to — Fields may be added to process-log lines, but the required ones are never renamed or removed. · why: The harness greps on them.
decision/r8-strip-logged-as-names-only · R8 strip logged as names only — The R8 environment strip is logged as a count and lists of stripped and kept variable names, values never read, and environment maps never pass to a span or event.
decision/single-line-log-records · Single-line log records — Every log record is one JSON line parseable by jq; never a multi-line stack trace.
decision/tests-event-list-adopted · Tests event list adopted — The tests' field and event list is adopted verbatim, with send-issued and send-refused among the logged events.
decision/tracing-json-logging-pipeline · tracing with a JSON subscriber for logging — Logging and spans go through the Rust tracing facade with a tracing-subscriber JSON structured logger.
contract/diag-line-event/release-from-driver · Diag line event · release-from-driver — release-from-driver is its own logged event, admitted by the diag-line schema, not a generic -32602 wrapper fault.
contract/mcp-stdin/line-within-max-frame · viola mcp stdin · line within MAX_FRAME — A line of at most MAX_FRAME bytes, its newline counted, passes whole.
contract/mcp-stdin/oversize-before-initialize · viola mcp stdin · oversize line before initialize — An oversize line before initialize exits the process 1 with both streams empty and the one parse-rejected record.
contract/process-log/child-and-probe-lifecycle · Process log · child and probe lifecycle — process-start and process-exit are logged for the claude child and for the claude agents --json and --version probes.
contract/process-log/corr · Process log line · corr — Copied unchanged as a JSON number or string, never renamed.
contract/process-log/instance · Process log line · instance — A ViolaName or null.
contract/process-log/level · Process log line · level — One of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.
contract/process-log/message · Process log line · message — A required field, as fields.message or the flattened message.

contract/process-log/timestamp · Process log line · timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z.

## 2-telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin telemetry-strategy
decision/span-naming · Span naming as <area>.<operation> — Span names are <area>.<operation> in snake_case, <area> one of run, pty, channel, state, hook, statusline, send, wait, last, answer, pause, release, cli, mcp; cli.<verb> names the dispatch span of a short-lived verb.
decision/spans-not-serialized-v1 · Spans declared but not serialized — Spans are declared in code but not serialized in v1.
contract/process-log-line/duration-ms · the process log line · duration_ms — Durations are duration_ms as an integer.
contract/process-log-line/enum-values · the process log line · enum values — Enum values are kebab-case.
contract/process-log-line/event · the process log line · event — The event field is a closed kebab-case enum; a new value needs a Decisions Log entry, and each value fixes what its corr holds.
decision/machine-parseable-signals · Every signal machine-parseable — Every signal produces machine-parseable output: JSON-per-line process logs, the ndjson product event stream, JSON harness documents, hyperfine JSON for perf gates and nextest JUnit XML in CI.
decision/metrics-derived-by-jq · Metrics derived by jq, no instruments — Metrics have no in-process instruments and no exporter; they are derived by jq over the ndjson logs.
decision/no-human-gated-log-analysis · No human-review-gated log analysis — Every log verdict is a jq or harness assertion that sets an exit code, never a human review.
contract/process-log-line/field-names · the process log line · field names — Field names are snake_case.

## telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin 2-telemetry-strategy
decision/span-naming-skip-all · Span declaration convention — Every span is declared with instrument, skip_all and a name of the form "<area>.<operation>".
decision/spans-not-serialized-in-v1 · Spans declared but not serialized in v1 — Spans are declared on the must-trace paths and every crate seam but are not written to output in v1. · why: they give the code its structure and are ready for the deferred OpenTelemetry bridge
decision/metrics-derived-from-ndjson · Metrics derived from logs, no instruments — There are no in-process metric instruments and no exporter; metrics are derived by jq over the ndjson logs, and perf gates run on hyperfine JSON exports.
contract/socket-dir-refused-exit/codes · socket-dir-refused exit codes · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory logs detail socket-dir-refused with no path, pid or uid, and exits 21 at the eight CLI frame verbs and 1 at run and revive's start.

## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/codes-only-process-logs · Codes-only process logs, content in detail files — Every role's codes-only process log goes to its home-level role file under diagnostics, and content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's per-role detail file.
decision/obs-owns-logger-and-format · Obs owns the logger and format — The logger and the log format are owned by observability.

## 4-span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin span-trace-coverage
decision/dependency-targets-off-in-sink · rmcp and portable-pty targets off — The rmcp and portable-pty log targets are switched OFF in the sink.
decision/detail-codes-only · detail is a closed code — The detail field is a closed kebab-case code catalog and never carries a path or pid.
decision/env-names-only · Environment names only, never values — The strip and every log record environment variable names only, never values, and no env map is passed to a span or event. · guard: E2
decision/manual-spans-only · Manual spans only — Every span is written by hand; no surface uses an auto-instrumentation library.
decision/no-assistant-message-in-logs · No assistant message or result body in logs — last_assistant_message never appears in a log, and no result body reaches a log line.
decision/no-endpoint-path-or-env-in-spans · No endpoint, binary path or env values in spans — A span never carries the endpoint name, the pinned_bin path or environment values.
decision/no-err-ret-span-options · err and ret span options banned — The err and ret instrumentation options are banned on spans.
decision/span-field-allow-list · Spans declared with explicit field allow-list — Every span is declared skipping all arguments with an explicit field allow-list.
decision/span-kinds-not-emitted-v1 · Span kinds recorded but not emitted — Span kinds are recorded in the plan per span but not emitted in v1; if the deferred tracing-opentelemetry bridge is adopted, they map to the otel.kind span field.
decision/static-span-names · Static span names — Span names are static strings; instance names, dialog ids and paths never appear in a span name.
decision/ci-verify-fake-agent-only · CI verify against the fake agent only — In CI, viola verify runs only against the fake agent.
decision/mid-call-disconnect-logged-once · Mid-call disconnect logged once — A disconnect in the middle of a call is logged once, by the client.
decision/no-trace-and-span-ids · No trace_id or span_id — Log lines never emit trace_id or span_id; correlation is by corr plus conn. · why: No W3C trace context exists, and spans are not attached to lines.

## span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin 4-span-trace-coverage
decision/no-paths-in-run-spans · No endpoint, path or env values on start spans — Start spans never carry the endpoint name, the pinned binary path or environment values.
decision/peer-euid-must-match · Server euid must match the client's — Every client seam refuses a server of another euid, or one whose euid cannot be read, after the connect and before the pid comparison; reading the euid writes and logs nothing.
contract/revive-process-log/agents-probe · viola revive run process log · agents-probe — The session-live reading writes one process-start and process-exit{subject:"agents-probe"} pair, plus one parse-rejected{parser:"claude-agents-json"} on an oversize or malformed answer.
contract/span-kinds/client · Span kinds · CLIENT — The CLIENT spans are send.client, wait.block, last.client, answer.client, pause.client, release.client, cli.link, cli.unlink, channel.request (client side), statusline.shell_out and pty.spawn.
contract/statusline-log-fields/parse-rejected · statusline hook log fields · parse-rejected — parse-rejected{parser:"hook-stdin", detail:"oversize"|"malformed", count:1} for stdin the arm rejects.
decision/clients-screen-peer-replies-to-code-words · Clients screen peer replies to code words and a fixed fault — The CLI and MCP clients screen a peer reply before using it: a refusal and its detail must be code words, a wrapper fault keeps only its code, a fixed message and closed data, and the screening adds no span and no line. · why: No path or upstream text may cross from a wrapper into a document, a tool result or a log.
decision/disconnect-logged-by-client · Mid-call disconnect logged once by the client — A mid-call disconnect is logged once, by the client.
decision/no-text-in-telemetry · Sent text never in telemetry — The sent text never appears in a span or log line; only its length does.
decision/real-cli-verify-never-in-ci · Real-CLI verify never runs in CI — In CI verify runs only against the fake agent; the real-CLI verify runs only through the local live run, which refuses under CI.
contract/diag-line-schema/os · diag-line v1 schema · os — os is closed to linux.
contract/run-log-parse-rejected/ledger-stamps · the run process log parse-rejected line · parser ledger-stamps — An unreadable, malformed or strict-modes-refused capability ledger gives one parse-rejected line with parser "ledger-stamps", detail "unreadable", "malformed" or "strict-modes-failed", and a count, in the run log.
contract/run-process-log/version-probe · run process log · version-probe — process-start and process-exit{subject:"version-probe", child_exit_status, duration_ms}.

## 5-metric-coverage · ## 5. Metric Coverage · twin metric-coverage
decision/metrics-derived-from-logs · Metrics derived from logs — Every metric is logical, computed by jq or the harness over the JSON-per-line logs or from hyperfine output, never by OTel or metrics-crate instruments. · why: There is no reader or exporter to flush instruments.

## metric-coverage · ## 5. Metric Coverage · twin 5-metric-coverage
decision/panic-lines-stay-zero · Panic lines stay at zero — Gate G2 counts the panic lines of the home-level role files and fails on any; no viola.panic metric is derived.

## 6-log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin log-coverage
decision/additive-field-naming · Additive log field naming — Additive log fields are snake_case with kebab-case values, and carry codes only.
decision/content-detail-in-instance-file · Content-bearing detail in the instance detail file — Content-bearing detail goes only to the per-process detail file inside the instance's diagnostics directory.
decision/ipc-calls-logged-without-arguments · IPC calls logged without arguments — IPC params and result bodies are never recorded, not even as a hash or digest.
decision/log-schema-additive-only · Log schema additive to the tests' format — The observability log schema only adds fields and enum values to the tests' log format; it renames and removes nothing. · why: The tests' log format is the binding text.
decision/third-party-crate-logs-off · Third-party crate logs off — The per-module log filter turns logging OFF for the rmcp, portable_pty, sysinfo and interprocess targets. · why: Their failures are captured at the viola seam as viola events.
decision/unlisted-targets-log-off · Unlisted log targets off — The per-module log filter turns logging OFF for every target it does not list.
decision/viola-crates-log-at-info · Viola crates log at INFO — The per-module log filter sets the viola, viola_core, viola_pty, viola_channel, viola_state, viola_agent_claude and viola_mcp targets to INFO, or DEBUG via diagnostics_level.
contract/child-spawn-log/claude-agents-json-parse-failure · child and shell spawn log events · claude agents --json parse failure — A claude agents --json parse failure gives one parse-rejected{parser:"claude-agents-json"} line and the value "unknown".
contract/child-spawn-log/subject · child and shell spawn log events · subject — process-start and process-exit lines for child and shell spawns carry a subject from a closed set.
contract/log-levels/error · log levels · error — Used for a panic, a process-exit that carries a detail, and a channel-response with error_code -32603.
contract/log-levels/info · log levels · info — INFO carries all other boundary, lifecycle and state-transition events, including refusals, which are normal product outcomes.
contract/log-levels/warn · log levels · warn — WARN carries state-recovered; parse-rejected; hook-decision with a fail-open detail; process-exit with exit 21; channel-response with -32600 or -32602.
contract/log-line/event · every log line · event — A value of the closed kebab-case event enum.
decision/no-event-type-field · No event_type field — Log lines carry no event_type field. · why: event already does that job, and a duplicate would amount to a rename.
decision/skipped-symlink-never-logged · Skipped symlink never named in logs — The entry name and link target of a skipped symlink are never logged.
contract/log-levels/trace · log levels · trace — TRACE is never emitted; the level exists only in the tests' level enum.
contract/log-line/corr · every log line · corr — Set per the tests' table and copied unchanged as a JSON number or string; null is represented by the key's absence.
contract/log-line/instance · every log line · instance — The ViolaName; the key is absent when there is none.
contract/log-line/level · every log line · level — One of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR; TRACE is never emitted.
contract/log-line/message · every log line · message — Flattened, a static literal equal to the event name.
contract/log-line/target · every log line · target — The Rust module path, for example viola_channel::server.
contract/log-line/timestamp · every log line · timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z.

## log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin 6-log-coverage
decision/unemittable-schema-words-removed · Schema words no build can emit are removed — A closed word of the diag-line schema that no build can emit leaves the schema with its emitter; os is closed at linux.
contract/diag-detail/socket-dir-refused · diagnostic detail words · socket-dir-refused — A closed detail on process-exit and hook-decision for a socket dir refused as a symlink, no directory, foreign owner or mode bit: run and revive's start write process-exit exit 1, CLI frame verbs process-exit exit 21 during connect at WARN, viola hook a hook-decision at WARN; MCP writes none.
contract/diag-line-fields/parse-rejected · diagnostic line additive fields · parse-rejected — parser (claude-agents-json, vt100-feed, config-json, ledger-stamps, hook-stdin, channel-frame, mcp-stdin, state-entry), detail, count.
contract/diag-line-fields/process-exit · diagnostic line additive fields · process-exit — subject, exit_code (self), child_exit_status, shell_exit_status, exit_source (handle-wait or kill-fallback), detail, during (connect or call), duration_ms.
contract/diag-line-fields/process-start · diagnostic line additive fields · process-start — subject (self, claude-child, version-probe, verify-probe, verify-pty-probe, agents-probe, statusline-shell), service_name, version, os, pid, child_pid, endpoint_kind, pty_backend, cli_version, cli_verified, env_stripped_count, env_stripped_known, env_kept (names only).
contract/parse-rejected-detail/malformed · parse-rejected detail · malformed — Any parser.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/oversize · parse-rejected detail · oversize — channel-frame beyond MAX_FRAME, hook-stdin, mcp-stdin past MAX_FRAME, vt100-feed when the bounded queue drops a copy (one line per poisoning episode), claude-agents-json past MAX_FRAME.
contract/parse-rejected/claude-agents-json · parse-rejected diagnostic line · parser claude-agents-json — A claude agents --json parse failure, oversize or malformed, gives one parse-rejected line with parser claude-agents-json and the value unknown.
contract/diag-subject/agents-probe · diag-line subject enum · agents-probe — Subject of the process-start and process-exit pair of the claude agents read, written by viola list, viola revive's session-live reading, verify's Run B and the list tool of viola mcp into their role files.

contract/parse-rejected/mcp-stdin-oversize · parse-rejected diagnostic line · parser mcp-stdin, detail oversize — Written at WARN into mcp.ndjson once per session, after the session ends, only when the stdin reader cut a line past MAX_FRAME, with count 1; the line holds no byte of the cut line.

## 7-error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin error-capture-reporting
decision/boundary-errors-end-in-logged-line · Crate-seam errors end in a logged line — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam ends in a logged process-exit detail, channel-response error, hook-decision detail or send-refused line, carrying codes only at WARN or ERROR.
decision/typed-errors-fixed-display · Typed errors with fixed Display messages — Every typed error has a fixed-message Display, written with thiserror, and holds no fields with paths or payloads. · except: PtyError's Display is hand-written, as viola-pty takes no thiserror.
decision/anyhow-at-dispatch-edge-only · anyhow at the dispatch edge only — anyhow is used only at the root binary's dispatch edge and its catch-site reporter.
decision/full-error-chain-in-detail-file-only · Full error chain in the detail file only — The full error chain is written as a one-line JSON array chain:[...] only to the instance's per-process detail file, and only when an instance resolves.
decision/instance-unreachable-not-logged · instance-unreachable logged by no line — An MCP instance-unreachable reject, from any instance, liveness, socket-directory, euid or server-verification check, is logged by no line; the isError code is its only record.
decision/mcp-rejects-codes-only · MCP rejects are codes only — MCP rejects are isError codes only, and a logged reject's line holds codes only.
decision/scrubbing-at-source · Scrubbing at the source — Error scrubbing sits at the source, not in a reporter's before_send hook. · why: No reporter exists.
contract/detail-file-line/correlation-keys · the detail-file error line · correlation keys — The detail-file line for an error carries the same event, corr and conn as its home-level counterpart, so jq joins them.

## error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin 7-error-capture-reporting
decision/env-vars-not-config-channel · Env vars are not a configuration channel — Backtrace capture is not gated by RUST_BACKTRACE or any env var. · why: env vars are not a configuration channel
decision/not-a-directory-refusal-message-fixed · NotADirectory refusal message is fixed and pathless — The NotADirectory strict-modes refusal reads the fixed message "a trusted state path is not a directory" and names no path. · why: The security plan's fixed-message rule keeps paths out of error text, and the fixed-messages unit test pins every refusal's text.
contract/mcp-frame-tools/socket-dir-refused · viola mcp frame tools · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory returns isError instance-unreachable with detail socket-dir-refused, and writes no frame and no line.
contract/mcp-stdin/oversize-line · viola mcp stdin · line past MAX_FRAME — A line past MAX_FRAME is refused whole, gives no isError result and ends the session as a closed stdin: exit 0 after initialize, exit 1 before it with both streams empty; its one record is parse-rejected mcp-stdin oversize, no byte of the line.

## 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/claude-agents-rows-never-logged · claude agents rows never logged verbatim — claude agents --json rows are never logged verbatim, only parse-rejected counts.
decision/content-canary-never-home-level · Content canary never in home-level files — The content canary never appears in a home-level diagnostics ndjson file.
decision/content-only-in-detail-file · Content-bearing records only in the detail file — Content-bearing records go only to the instance-scoped detail-<process>.ndjson file.
decision/default-deny-log-fields · Default-deny for logged fields — A field is logged only if it is named in the obs plan's event catalog; an unknown field is a build failure. · guard: gate G4 against schemas/diag-line.v1.json
decision/detail-schema-self-contained · Separate self-contained detail-line schema — Detail-file lines are validated by their own schema with a top-level unevaluatedProperties false, which inlines the event enum and uses no cross-file reference.
decision/fixed-error-messages · Fixed error messages — Error Display texts are fixed, and serde-sourced error chains are mapped to fixed messages at dispatch.
decision/home-level-lines-path-free · Home-level lines path-free — Home-level log lines are path-free: file fields are basenames, panic_location is workspace-relative and source file recording is off; absolute paths appear only in detail files. · why: The OS username inside absolute paths is the only PII in scope.
decision/low-class-metadata-as-typed-fields · Low-class metadata as typed fields — Low-class metadata is logged as typed fields, never inside detail codes.
decision/no-allow-list-widening · Allow-list cannot be widened — No config key, flag or env var can widen the logged-field allow-list or disable redaction.
decision/schema-top-level-unevaluated-properties · Default-deny schema via top-level unevaluatedProperties — The diagnostics line schema enforces default-deny with a top-level unevaluatedProperties false over per-event field lists. · why: in JSON Schema 2020-12 additionalProperties does not see properties declared inside allOf or if-then · guard: contract_diag_schema
decision/source-allow-list-logging · Source allow-list for logged fields — Spans skip all arguments and declare fields explicitly, and events go through obs_event! with explicit typed fields only; this source allow-list is the primary PII control. · guard: disallowed-macros; raw_event_hits; G1 bare instrument
decision/detail-upload-synthetic-inputs-only · Detail-file upload only with synthetic inputs — Detail files and the harness capture are uploaded only while every input is synthetic; a non-synthetic source first drops them from the upload paths. · why: every input is synthetic, so detail content carries no real data
decision/endpoint-and-pinned-bin-never-logged · endpoint and pinned_bin never logged — The endpoint and pinned_bin values are never logged.
decision/no-regex-scrubbers · No regex scrubbers — Sensitive data is never scrubbed by regular expressions. · why: viola's sensitive data is known by type
decision/veil-redact-second-layer · veil Redact as the second redaction layer — veil's derive Redact is the second redaction layer, so a stray value capture prints [REDACTED] instead of content.
contract/detail-line/chain · the detail-file line · chain — One of exactly four content fields a detail-file line may carry: the full error chain.

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/agent-rows-never-verbatim · Agent rows never logged verbatim — claude agents --json rows are untrusted and never logged verbatim, only parse-rejected counts.
decision/closed-protocol-codes · Closed protocol codes — Protocol codes and refusal details are logged as closed kebab-case enums naming no param or value. · guard: answer_invalid_params_names_its_cause_and_no_param
decision/detail-upload-needs-synthetic-input · Detail upload needs synthetic input — Detail files and harness captures are uploaded only while every input is synthetic; a non-synthetic input source must first drop detail files and the harness capture from the upload paths.
decision/endpoint-paths-never-logged · Endpoint and pinned binary never logged — The snapshot endpoint and pinned_bin are never logged, only endpoint_kind.
decision/error-messages-interpolate-nothing · Error messages interpolate nothing — thiserror messages interpolate no value. · guard: thiserror_messages_interpolate_nothing
decision/fixtures-not-a-telemetry-source · Fixtures not a telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are not a telemetry source, and observability adds no fixture content.
decision/socket-dir-refusal-names-nothing · Socket-directory refusal names nothing — A socket-directory refusal carries no path, pid or uid in its lines and documents, and its human pair names only the parsed instance name. · guard: security_negatives_socket_dir
decision/typed-ids-never-in-detail · Ids logged as typed fields — pid, child_pid, agent_session_id, started_at, budget percentages and resets_at are logged as typed fields, never inside detail codes.
decision/veil-redaction · veil derives redaction — veil 0.3.0's derived Redact is what redacts the payload fields of contract types, and instrumented spans skip all arguments.
decision/canary-only-in-detail-files · Canary only in detail files — Every E2E and integration input is synthetic and embeds a fixed canary, which may appear in detail files but never in a home-level diagnostics file. · guard: mcp_tools_a_line_past_max_frame_ends_the_session_with_one_line
decision/prompt-and-output-never-in-home-logs · Prompt and assistant output never in home logs — Prompt text and assistant output, last_assistant_message included, never appear in a home-level process-log line; they reach an instance detail file only inside a chain or drift report, and only text_bytes is logged.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/g2-zero-panics-gate · Zero-panics gate fails closed — The zero-panics gate probes itself first, fails closed, runs in the test and perf jobs, and counts panics over home-level role files only. · guard: G2 · except: the fake-agent seam's forced panic at exactly its seam location, compared as a whole string
decision/g4-schema-conformance-gate · Schema conformance gate on every line — Every home-level line is validated against the diagnostics line schema and every detail line against the detail schema, in a step that always runs. · guard: G4
decision/ci-on-github-actions · CI on GitHub Actions — CI runs on GitHub Actions in one push and pull-request workflow on an ubuntu-latest matrix, beside a scheduled nightly workflow for advisory checks and fuzzing; there is no OTLP collector job.
decision/g1-bare-instrument-gate · G1 bare-instrument gate fails closed — Every #[instrument] must have skip_all as its first argument; the G1 gate passes only on rg exit 1 (no match), so a violation, a regex or I/O error or a missing rg fails the CI step. · guard: G1

## ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin 9-ci-integration
decision/banned-telemetry-dependencies · Banned telemetry and logging dependencies — opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry, tracing-appender, the tracing-subscriber env-filter feature and the veil toggle feature are not taken as dependencies. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/diag-lines-schema-checked-in-unit-tests · Emitted lines schema-checked in integration and E2E tests — Emitted role lines are checked against schemas/diag-line.v1.json by integration tests and the E2E schema_check over real process output; unit tests check only detail lines, against schemas/diag-detail.v1.json.
decision/no-raw-tracing-macros · No raw tracing macros outside the obs module — Raw tracing info, warn, error, debug and trace macros and raw event! are refused outside viola_core::obs. · guard: clippy -D warnings disallowed-macros; raw-event! grep and ban probes in scripts/lint-probes.sh
decision/os-gated-test-census · OS-gated test census — Every OS-gated test function or file must be named in the census with a non-empty reason, and a gate predicate naming windows or macos is a fault even when named. · guard: contract_os_gated_tests
decision/schema-conformance-gate · Schema conformance gate on real process output — Every role-file line of test homes must validate against schemas/diag-line.v1.json and every detail line against schemas/diag-detail.v1.json; a failing line fails the build, a torn non-JSON line is skipped and counted. · why: schema failures count as a build failure and unit tests check only in-memory lines · guard: gate G4 (schema-conformance step)
decision/sync-crates-without-tokio · Sync crates build without Tokio — The synchronous crates must compile without Tokio. · guard: cargo check of the sync crates without Tokio
decision/zero-panics-gate · Zero panics gate — No panic line may appear in the home-level role files of test runs; detail files repeat the panic line and are excluded. · why: ratified · guard: gate G2 (scripts/g2-zero-panics.sh, --probe first) · except: a panic whose panic_location is exactly src/cmd/hook/seam.rs:<digits>, the fake-agent seam's forced panic, compared as a whole string
decision/instrument-requires-skip-all · Instrument attribute must skip all arguments — Every #[instrument] in the workspace takes skip_all as its first argument; a bare #[instrument] fails the build. · guard: gate G1

## 10-slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & Telemetry Budgets · twin slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets
decision/build-fails-on-any-panic · Build fails on any panic line — The build fails on any panic event line in the kept homes' role files, bar the fake-agent seam's forced panic; no gate infers a panic from an exit code.
decision/cargo-deny-failure-fails · cargo deny failure is a failure — A cargo deny failure (Tokio, a C crate, veil toggle, banned obs crates) counts as an SLO invariant failure. · guard: cargo deny
decision/deterministic-emission · Deterministic event emission — Events key on hook events and events.ndjson offsets; nothing is derived from screen content. · except: The readiness gate reads the vt100 screen before a paste, and its verdict can refuse a send as input-not-ready.
decision/error-budget-zero-tolerance · Zero-tolerance error budget — The error budget tolerates zero panic lines in any CI artifact, zero secret-scan hits and zero schema-conformance failures. · except: the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic, as the zero-panics gate counts it
decision/lint-probes-failure-fails · Lint-probes failure is a failure — A lint-probes failure (a ban that did not fire, a control that did not pass, or a raw event! outside the core obs module) counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/module-boundary-error-logging · Errors logged once at module boundaries — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam is logged once at WARN or ERROR with a closed detail or error_code; the full chain goes only to the instance detail file.
decision/print-and-macro-lint-failure-fails · Print and macro lint failure is a failure — A clippy disallowed-macros, print_stdout, print_stderr or dbg_macro failure counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/schema-conformance-failure-fails · Schema-conformance failure is a failure — An unknown event value, a missing required field or a field outside the catalog counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/secret-scan-hit-fails · Secret-scan hit is a failure — A secret-scan hit counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/zero-unlogged-panics · Zero unlogged panics — Every panic in run, hook, mcp and cli after init step 4 produces exactly one single-line ERROR panic record in its home-level role file, with no multi-line backtrace there, and hook still exits 0; retry-once policies for panic handling are forbidden. · guard: G2 · except: the bounded exemptions where no file exists, so no line can be written; G2 alone leaves out the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic from its count.

## slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & Telemetry Budgets · twin 10-slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets
decision/panic-count-home-level-only · Panic count reads home-level files only — The exactly-one panic rule and gate G2 count home-level role files only; the companion panic line in a detail file is excluded. · guard: gate G2 · except: G2 alone leaves out the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic, whose line is still written exactly once.

## 11-obs-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. Obs Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these) · twin obs-anti-patterns
decision/closed-event-and-corr-on-every-line · Closed event enum on every line, corr where correlated — Every log line carries the closed event enum, and corr rides only on the correlated events the schema allows it on, so the signal pyramid never collapses into free text.
decision/event-values-closed · event values closed — No event value is added without a Decisions Log entry.
decision/low-cardinality-span-names · Low-cardinality span names — Span names never contain instance names, dialog ids or paths.
decision/no-bare-instrument · No bare #[instrument] — Instrumentation always uses #[instrument(skip_all, fields(...))], never a bare #[instrument]. · why: A bare #[instrument] records every argument with Debug and leaks send text, hook.dialog payloads and tool input.
decision/no-instrument-err-ret-on-sensitive · No instrument err or ret on sensitive results — #[instrument(err)] and #[instrument(ret)] are never used where the error or return can carry a serde or serde_path_to_error source or user content.
decision/no-paths-or-pids-in-detail-codes · No paths or pids in detail codes — detail codes never contain paths or pids.
decision/no-pii-in-span-fields · No PII or content in span fields — Span fields never include PII or content. · why: Scrubbing at an exporter stage is too late, and v1 has no exporter stage at all.
decision/no-print-macros · No print macros in product code paths — print!, println!, eprint!, eprintln! and dbg! are never used in the hook, run or mcp code paths of the product crates, and every product member inherits the workspace lints. · why: They bypass the file sink and break the Hook contract, the run terminal rule and MCP framing. · guard: clippy print_stdout, print_stderr and dbg_macro at deny · except: viola-harness, the fake agent and the output modules that own --json, human CLI stderr and the hook decision body.
decision/no-serde-source-in-error-output · No serde source in printed errors — An anyhow chain that still contains a serde_json or serde_path_to_error source is never printed to stderr, --json, MCP isError or channel error.data.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen-content · No telemetry from screen content — Telemetry is never derived from screen content; vt100 is used for readiness and modal gate outcomes only.
decision/obs-event-macro-only · obs_event! is the only event macro — tracing's event and level macros are never called directly outside viola_core::obs; events go through obs_event!. · why: Only obs_event! guarantees event, process and instance. · guard: clippy disallowed-macros; the raw-event! grep in lint-probes
decision/paths-only-in-instance-detail-files · Paths only in instance detail files — Paths appear only in instance detail files.
decision/allow-list-not-widenable · Allow-list and redaction not configurable — config.json, a VIOLA_* env var or a CLI flag never widens the field allow-list or disables redaction.
decision/explicit-corr-conn-instance · corr, conn and instance passed explicitly — corr, conn and instance are passed as explicit values across threads or tasks, never carried by span context. · why: Spans are not serialized.
decision/field-allow-list-default-deny · Field allow-list is default-deny — No field is logged unless named in the field catalog.
decision/latency-with-gate-statistic · Latency reported with the gate statistic — Latency is never reported without the gate statistic; p50 and p95 are report-only.
decision/no-log-bridge · No log bridge — tracing_log::LogTracer or any log bridge is never installed by hand, and tracing-log stays off. · why: Bridged records lack event, corr, process and instance.
decision/no-telemetry-on-stdout · No telemetry on stdout — Telemetry is never written to stdout on any role. · why: stdout carries each role's own output and run's terminal carries the child's screen.
decision/scrub-before-bytes-leave-process · Scrubbing before any byte leaves the process — Every byte is scrubbed of secrets before it leaves the process; in v1 the only destination is local files. · guard: the secret-scan test
decision/sensitive-content-detail-file-only · Sensitive content only in the instance detail file — statusline_command, send text, tool input and last_assistant_message never reach a home-level file; they may reach only the instance-scoped detail-<process>.ndjson, inside a chain or drift report.

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/content-only-in-instance-detail-file · Content only in instance-scoped detail files — Content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's detail-<process>.ndjson file; home-level log files are codes-only and carry no user content, token or CLAUDE* value. · why: security allows user-derived content only in instance-scoped diagnostics
decision/diag-schema-matches-event-enum · Diagnostic line schema matches the event enum — A hand-maintained JSON Schema of the process-log line is committed, and its event enum must equal the ObsEvent variants, asserted by a tests-owned check.
decision/fixed-error-display · Fixed error Display text — Typed errors have fixed Display text that carries no interpolated content.
decision/instrument-skip-all-everywhere · Spans skip all arguments — Every instrumented function uses skip_all with explicit fields, so no argument is recorded implicitly. · guard: G1
decision/obs-event-single-macro · One obs_event macro for every line — Every log line is emitted through the one obs_event macro defined in viola-core, which expands to tracing's event at the caller, so viola-core stays I/O-free and tracing-free.
decision/raw-tracing-ban · Raw tracing macros banned — The tracing level macros are banned by clippy disallowed-macros and raw event calls by a fail-closed grep outside the obs module, so only obs_event emits lines. · why: clippy reports a disallowed macro expanded inside an exported macro at the caller, so no allow inside obs_event can exempt it · guard: clippy disallowed-macros and scripts/lint-probes.sh
decision/subscriber-only-in-root-bin · tracing-subscriber only in the root binary — tracing-subscriber is a product dependency of the root binary only, without its chrono feature; the product crates depend on tracing alone. · except: a library crate may take it as a dev-dependency for in-memory line capture in its own unit tests
decision/veil-redact-payload-types · veil redacts payload types — Payload types derive veil's Redact, and cargo deny bans veil's toggle feature. · guard: cargo deny veil toggle ban · except: A payload type with no content field derives neither veil Redact nor Debug, because veil 0.3.0 refuses a Redact derive with no redact field.
decision/no-opentelemetry-in-v1 · No OpenTelemetry in v1 — No opentelemetry crate is added in v1, and cargo deny bans opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry and tracing-appender on the workspace. · why: so they cannot arrive transitively without a Decisions Log entry · guard: cargo deny bans

## log-file-location · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
contract/diagnostics-files/paths · diagnostics files · process log paths — Process logs are written to <home>/diagnostics/ as run-<name>, hook-<name>, mcp and cli-<name> .ndjson files, and detail to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson.

## log-format-json-schema · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/no-multiline-stack-traces · No multi-line stack traces — Every log line is one physical line parseable by jq; a hook panic is caught and logged as one ERROR line with event panic.
contract/corr-by-event/parse-rejected · corr by event · parse-rejected — corr is null.
contract/corr-by-event/process-and-panic · corr by event · process-start, process-exit, panic — corr is null.
contract/process-log-line/message · the process log line · message — The message is a static literal equal to the event name and never carries interpolated content.
decision/null-as-key-absence · Null written as key absence — A null corr or instance is written as an absent key, readers treat absence and null as equal, and the schema rejects a literal null. · why: tracing has no null field value
decision/obs-aligns-to-tests-log-format · Observability aligns to the tests log format — The log format is bound by the test plan's harness contract; observability may add fields but must not rename or remove its fields. · why: the harness greps on them
contract/process-log-line/corr · the process log line · corr — Copied unchanged as a JSON number or string, never renamed and never debug- or display-formatted; required only on the events whose rules always define it.
contract/process-log-line/instance · the process log line · instance — The instance's name, or absent when none resolved.
contract/process-log-line/level · the process log line · level — One of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.
contract/process-log-line/process · the process log line · process — One of run, hook, mcp, cli; cli is a short-lived verb with a resolved instance, writing cli-<name>.ndjson.
contract/process-log-line/target · the process log line · target — The target is always present.
contract/process-log-line/timestamp · the process log line · timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z.

## logging-stack · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/content-records-bypass-subscriber · Content-bearing records bypass the subscriber — Content-bearing records never pass through the tracing subscriber, whose one writer holds only the home-level role file; the detail writer formats each detail line itself and writes it with one whole write.
decision/no-content-in-home-level-lines · No content fields in home-level lines — No home-level diagnostics line carries chain, drift_report, panic_payload or backtrace. · guard: G4 diag-line.v1.json schema
decision/third-party-targets-off · Third-party log targets off — Records of third-party targets (rmcp, portable_pty, sysinfo, interprocess) are off in every sink; their failures are captured at viola's seam from the returned results. · why: Their records lack the required fields.
decision/tracing-logging-library · tracing as the logging library — tracing is the logging facade and tracing-subscriber's JSON formatter writes the lines. · why: Tokio-free and no C, and meets the security floor for tracing-subscriber
contract/detail-line/fields · the detail line · fields — Each detail line carries timestamp (millisecond UTC format), level, target, message, event, process and instance, then its content fields, and no corr or conn key.
contract/diagnostics-files/detail · the diagnostics files · detail — Content-bearing records (full error chains, drift reports, panic payload and backtrace) go only to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson, file 0600 in a 0700 directory, and only when an instance resolves.
contract/diagnostics-line/role-file-line-size · the diagnostics line · role-file line size — A line in a role file (run, hook, mcp, cli) is codes-only and stays well under 4 KiB.
contract/obs-event-macro/attached-fields · the obs_event macro · attached fields — Every line carries event from the ObsEvent enum's kebab name, plus process and instance from the process context, each absent when it has no value.
decision/file-only-diagnostics-sinks · File-only diagnostics, one file per role — Every role logs only to its own file under the home's diagnostics directory; no role has a stdout sink, and there is no pretty or dev sink.
decision/level-changes-volume-only · Level changes volume only — Every diagnostics level uses the same field allow-list, so the level changes only how many lines are written. · why: No setting can disable redaction.
decision/no-log-crate-bridge · No log-crate bridge — The log-crate bridge (tracing-log, LogTracer) stays off; failures are captured from returned values or handles, and a gap is fixed at the seam or by the researched json-subscriber fallback, never by enabling the bridge. · why: The accepted loss is only third-party log context emitted without a returned error. · guard: pty_exit_is_read_on_the_handle_while_the_output_is_held
decision/no-source-paths-in-logs · No source paths in diagnostics lines — Diagnostics lines carry no source file names or line numbers.
decision/no-span-list-in-lines · No span list in diagnostics lines — Diagnostics lines never carry the list of entered spans. · why: Closes the spans leak path.
decision/shared-log-files-concurrent-append · Concurrent appends to shared diagnostics files — Every diagnostics file may have concurrent writers in separate processes; each line is one whole write on an append-mode handle, readers tolerate a torn line, and a concurrent-append check, including a detail line over 4 KiB, asserts every line parses. · why: Non-interleaving at this size is an assumption, not a POSIX guarantee, because the 4 KiB PIPE_BUF rule applies to pipes. · guard: concurrent-append check; hook_panics_append_whole_lines_over_4_kib_side_by_side
contract/diagnostics-line/detail-line-size · the diagnostics line · detail-file line size — A line in an instance detail file (chains, drift reports, one-line backtraces) is not codes-only and may exceed 4 KiB.
contract/diagnostics-line/format · the diagnostics line · format — Each diagnostics line is one structured JSON object on one line, written whole by one write of the complete line on an append-mode handle.

## otel-sdk-init · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/lazy-detail-file · Detail file opened lazily — The instance detail file is opened only by the first content-bearing record or by the panic hook, and a failed detail open drops only the detail line, writing nothing to stderr. · why: The error-free hook path keeps exactly one log open.
decision/tracing-is-the-instrumentation-facade · tracing as the instrumentation facade — tracing is the instrumentation facade in every instrumentable crate, and tracing-subscriber is the formatter and sink, a product dependency of the root bin only.
decision/flat-log-lines-and-one-level-gate · Log lines are flat and Targets is the only level gate — The subscriber flattens event fields to the top level of each line, and the Targets filter is the only configurable level gate; its level comes from the home's diagnostics level and never from the environment. · why: The diagnostics schema and the log readers read event fields as top-level keys, and only the viola crates' targets pass the gate.
decision/millisecond-utc-timestamps · Millisecond UTC timestamps — Every diagnostics timestamp is RFC 3339 in UTC with millisecond precision and a Z suffix. · why: The default timer writes microseconds, and the chrono RFC 3339 timer writes +00:00 with automatic precision.
decision/no-otel-sdk-v1 · No OpenTelemetry SDK in v1 — No OpenTelemetry SDK, bridge or Resource is used in v1. · why: With no exporter they would add only dependency and cargo-mutants surface, and bridged span IDs would have no consumer.
decision/private-diagnostics-files · Owner-only diagnostics files — The diagnostics directory is 0700 and each diagnostics file 0600, opened without following symlinks; before the first write each must be owned by the effective user, have no group or other bits and not be a symlink, a failed check counting as a failed open. · why: A pre-existing foreign, permissive or symlinked diagnostics file is never written.
decision/strict-modes-before-diagnostics · Home strict-modes check before diagnostics — Nothing under the home, the diagnostics directory included, is created or opened before the role's strict-modes check on the home passes; a refused home gets no diagnostics line.

## service-identity · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/env-vars-not-configuration · Environment variables are not configuration — Environment variables are not a configuration channel: service identity has no env-var source or fallback.
decision/single-version-constant · One version constant for every crate — One compile-time version constant taken from the package version serves every crate, and every crate takes the workspace version. · why: The log version, channel sender and snapshot writer cannot drift apart.
contract/diagnostics-line/instance · the diagnostics line · instance — Every diagnostics line of a process with an instance carries it as field instance; a process without one, such as an mcp server with no instance name, writes no instance key.
contract/diagnostics-line/process · the diagnostics line · process — Every diagnostics line carries the role as field process.
contract/process-start/os · the process-start line · os — process-start carries field os, the one word linux.
contract/process-start/pid · the process-start line · pid — process-start carries the process id as field pid.
contract/process-start/service-name · the process-start line · service_name — process-start carries the service name as field service_name.
contract/process-start/version · the process-start line · version — process-start carries the product version as field version.

## trace-context-propagation · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/explicit-correlation-values · Correlation values passed explicitly — corr, conn and instance are passed as explicit values into each thread or task and set on each event, never recovered from span context. · why: Spans are not serialized.
decision/span-carried-into-tasks-and-threads · Span not carried into tasks and threads — Spawned async tasks and std thread closures take no span from their spawner: spans never reach a log line, and correlation travels as explicit typed fields.
