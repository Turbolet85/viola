# a11y-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-hyprland-seam — picked 20 of 241 (9 by every draw) · rule any · pin 1006

## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
contract/tui-passthrough/viola-terminal-bytes · viola run TUI passthrough · viola terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes of its own to the terminal; only the child's output reaches it.
decision/ci-test-gate-no-skips · CI test gate allows no skips — The CI test job's gate requires coverage and doctest and never allows skips.
decision/no-assertions-for-internal-crates · Internal crates not assertable — The internal crates of the modular monolith are not-assertable and carry no assertions. · why: library-only, with no UI surface
contract/tui-passthrough/run-diagnostics · viola run TUI passthrough · run diagnostics — viola's diagnostics for run go to diagnostics/, never to the terminal.

## a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin 1-a11y-scope-summary
decision/linux-only · Linux only — Every surface targets Linux only: the core on any current distribution, its CI on `ubuntu-latest`, and the 0.2.0 window features on Hyprland.
contract/tui-passthrough/own-bytes · TUI passthrough · terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes to the terminal except the child's output; a passed `viola revive` writes no line of its own while the child holds the terminal.
decision/run-diagnostics-off-terminal · Run diagnostics never reach the terminal — viola's diagnostics for `run` go to `diagnostics/`, never to the terminal.

## 8-cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin cognitive-accessibility
decision/time-bounds-never-on-human · Time bounds never fall on the human — Every time bound viola holds (wait timeout and cap, dialog hold, send readiness gate, confirmation windows, status-line deadline, agents read, budget pause) falls on the driver, the user's command or viola's child; no key is blocked, refused or delayed by it.

## cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin 8-cognitive-accessibility
decision/peer-replies-screened-to-code-words · Peer replies screened to code words — A peer's refusal that is no code word reads unknown, and a string detail that is no code word reads nothing (null under --json and on MCP).
decision/thiserror-messages-interpolate-nothing · thiserror messages interpolate nothing — No thiserror message interpolates a value. · guard: thiserror_messages_interpolate_nothing
decision/time-bounds-fall-on-the-driver · Time bounds fall on the driver only — Every time bound (MCP wait cap, dialog hold, readiness gate, confirm windows, budget pause, statusline deadline, agents read) falls on the driver or viola's own child, never blocking, refusing or delaying a human key and never moving the wheel.
contract/code-word/format · code word · format — 1 to 64 bytes of [a-z0-9-], a lower-case letter first.
decision/error-bodies-have-writer-and-witness · Error bodies have a writer and a witness — Each error body names a writer and a witness that stand, and each product error writer is named. · guard: error_bodies_each_name_a_writer_and_a_witness_that_stand

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration
decision/a11y-ci-github-actions · A11y checks in the GitHub Actions push/PR workflow — A11y checks run in the one GitHub Actions push/PR workflow on an `ubuntu-latest` matrix; the scheduled nightly workflow carries no a11y step.

## 10-slo-invariants-a11y-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & A11y Budgets
decision/a11y-gate-breach-fails-build · Gate breach fails the build — A `gate --require coverage,doctest` breach (`suite-failed`, `suite-skipped`, `suite-missing`, `artifact-missing`) fails the build and deploy.
decision/zero-flakiness · Zero flakiness, no retries — Tests and a11y checks run with `retries: 0` and `#[ignore]` banned; a flake keeps the work red until its root cause is fixed. · why: retry-once policies mask real signals (the agent-driven principle)

## 11-a11y-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. A11y Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
decision/machine-output-a11y-review · No human-only a11y review — No a11y review is human-only without machine output. · why: the canonical agent-runnable principle

## ci-integration · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/gate-requires-coverage-doctest · Gate requires coverage and doctest — The test job runs the harness and then gate --require coverage,doctest, with skips never allowed.

## keyboard-test-harness · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/live-readings-never-gate · Live readings never gate — Live readings of the takeover clause on a real terminal are supplemental and never gating.
decision/zero-viola-bytes-on-the-terminal · Zero viola bytes on the terminal — The outer-PTY stream holds no viola-originated bytes (no message literals, hint:, SGR or cursor control the child did not emit), compared byte for byte with an unwrapped run.
