- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - Fail-open paths are logged to `hook-<name>.ndjson` only: oversize stdin, malformed JSON, channel failure, server-verify mismatch, strict-modes failure, missing `VIOLA_NAME`. As landed a strict-modes failure is not logged: every `viola hook` arm but the two `--capture` arms — `hook statusline`, the event paths and the dialog paths — runs an instance check before obs init, and a refused check leaves no line (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor; the founder's own answer, 2026-10-13, relayed verbatim by the Viola overseer, the operator's answer at its planning superseded 2026-10-13).
  - A server-verify mismatch (Linux and Windows) is one `hook-decision{detail:"server-verify-failed"}` at WARN with no frame sent — on a dialog hook `hook-invoked{corr:null}` then `hook-decision{corr:null, decision_emitted:false, detail:"server-verify-failed"}` — and no pid, start time, path or endpoint in the line; macOS compares no peer pid (the recorded gap).
  - Exit is 0 and stderr stays empty.
  - Drift reports go to `diagnostics/` only.

One rejected call writes no line: a frame tool (`send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`) whose instance check (`check_instance`, before `live_endpoint`) refuses returns `instance-unreachable` with `detail: null` and writes no frame.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - `diagnostics/` files are 0600 in 0700 directories (Windows: home DACL), enforced by the tests secret-scan test.
  - Refusal telemetry for strict-modes failures, pinned-exe hash mismatches and ignored symlinks. As landed a strict-modes failure has a line in two places: the `ledger-stamps` read in `run`'s version gate, and on Windows x64 a refused `conpty/` companion (`PinError::StrictModes`), which `process-start` carries as `sideload_fallback` `strict-modes-failed`, the exit unchanged; a refused `update_stamps` in `viola verify` (`StampsError::StrictModes`) leaves only verify's own `process-exit` (with an instance; exit 1, no `detail`). Every other strict-modes refusal leaves no line: `viola revive`'s instance check, `run`'s and a revived start's home-tree check (`check_home_tree`, exit 1, before the wrapper log opens), `viola verify`'s home-tree check (exit 1), the instance check of every `viola hook` arm but the two `--capture` arms (exit 0), the instance check of `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause` and `release` (`refuse_untrusted`, exit 21), `viola link` / `viola unlink`'s instance check of the driven instance (made before any role file opens; exit 21), the `viola mcp` frame tools' instance check (`instance-unreachable`), the `diagnostics/` opens (`check_diagnostics`: a refusal is a failed open), the checked read of `budget.json` (`read_budget_stamped`, which the budget gate takes through `read_budget` and `viola list` takes directly, where a refused file is no reading) (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor), and `viola list`'s scan of the home, `instances/` and each instance, which refuses the whole board with exit 21 (chunk 2026-10-11-the-board-viola-list).
  - A pinned-exe hash mismatch is also reached when a start loses the pinned copy's no-clobber placement to a concurrent first start and the copy that stands re-hashes different (`place_absent`'s `PinError::HashMismatch`, `run.pin_copy` `pinned-hash-mismatch`, the file left as found); that path adds no line, field or `detail` code.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - `duration_ms` on `hook-decision`, or on `process-exit` for `process="hook"`, per hook event. The budget is `session-end` `max < 1.0 s`, and spine hooks and `pre-tool-use` on an unverified CLI must stay under the spine deadline (provisionally 1.0 s).
  - The heartbeat staleness flip happens at >5 s (4.9 s live / 5.1 s stale or gone).

  Aggregation into p95/p99 is done by the harness or `jq` over the ndjson, not by an in-process metrics pipeline (no listener, no exporter).

  - torn ndjson line healed, with file and offset;
  - corrupt or unsupported-`v` snapshot → replay recovery;
  - child exit detected on the process handle without EOF (ConPTY);
  - endpoint vanished during `wait` (exit 21 / `instance-unreachable`);
  - stale heartbeat vs live pid.

  These need `event` values or an additive `detail` field (section 3, gap b).

- **Required telemetry signal:** The same file sink and line schema on every OS. Platform differences must still yield identical fields:

  - append atomicity with concurrent hook writers: Windows append vs POSIX `O_APPEND`;
  - named pipe vs Unix socket in channel logs;
  - ConPTY vs openpty in `pty` spans.
  - the server check's peer-pid read: Linux `SO_PEERCRED` vs Windows `GetNamedPipeServerProcessId` vs macOS none (`SERVER_PID_REPORTED` false, so the verdict is `Matches` with no comparison and no `server-verify-failed` line is written there: the recorded gap, owned by "Unix endpoint and home hardening").

- **Required telemetry signal:** A zero-unlogged-panics invariant for all four process roles. Each panic produces exactly one single-line `event:"panic"` record and no multi-line backtrace, and `hook` still exits 0. A process whose role-file open fails — `check_diagnostics` refusing the `diagnostics/` folder or the role file included — has no panic sink, so a panic in it writes no record. No formal latency or availability SLO beyond the tests perf gates.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - `release-from-driver` is its own logged event, not a generic -32602 wrapper fault.
  - Each cause behind exit 21 (dead instance, strict-mode fail, server-verify fail) and exit 1 (already live, squatted name, SHA-256 mismatch, `.cmd`/`.bat` child, and `viola revive`'s no logged session and missing recorded directory) gets a distinct `detail` code with no path or pid. `viola revive`'s strict-mode fail carries no logged `detail` as landed (no log line): its output is the stderr pair, or under `--json` the `{"v":1,"error":"strict-modes-failed","detail":null}` document (chunk 2026-10-17-cli-machine-contract), exit 1 (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor). `viola link` / `viola unlink`'s strict-mode fail (their instance check of the driven instance) carries no logged `detail` either (no line): its output is the fixed instance-state `unable` / `hint:` pair on stderr, or under `--json` the `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":null}` document, exit 21.
  - The server-verify fail is written on Linux and Windows as `process-exit{subject:"self", exit_code:21, detail:"server-verify-failed", during:"connect"}` in `cli-<name>.ndjson` by `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release`, `link` and `unlink` (for `link` / `unlink` the driven instance's file), distinct from `instance-dead`, with no pid, start time, path or endpoint; macOS writes none (no peer pid, the recorded gap).

  - Higher-`v` rejections (`channel-response{error_code:-32602, detail:"unsupported-version"}`; the code also carries `detail:"invalid-params"` (`send`'s invalid params, and a `link` / `unlink` whose `driver` or `driven` is missing, not a string or no valid name, whose `driven` is not the serving wrapper's own name, or whose `driver` equals `driven`) and `detail:"release-from-driver"` (`release` carrying `from`), so the count reads `detail` and not the code).
