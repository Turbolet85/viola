- **Log file location:** Tests require `<home>/diagnostics/{run-<name>,hook-<name>,mcp,cli-<name>}.ndjson`. That differs from two upstream statements:
  - arch Obs-Relevant Conventions (Diagnostics location): `<viola home>/instances/<ViolaName>/diagnostics/`;
  - security Vector 2 and Data Classifications: only `instances/<name>/diagnostics/` may hold user content.

  Obs aligns to tests (tests is upstream) on file basenames and on the `logs` wrapper `{"src":"diag","file":<basename>,"record":<line>}`. The directory root (home-level or instance-level) must be reconciled in Phase 3/5 with a Decisions Log entry. If `mcp.ndjson` sits at home level, it must never carry user content.

  `mcp` always writes `<home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson`, as tests assume (D-09; stderr JSON only when the file cannot be opened; landed at chunk 2026-10-17-mcp-server-for-drivers).

  Every file is 0600 inside a 0700 directory (Windows: home DACL), and the tests secret-scan test enforces it. Retention is the lifetime of the session home (tests excerpt, `logs`); there is no rotation in v1 (security Vector 7).

Log events: `process-start` (run), `process-start` for the child, and `process-exit` on failure. The product event order to verify in `events.ndjson` is `wheel{cause:"start"}` → `budget-gate` → `session-start`.

- **Required log fields:** `event`, `process="run"`, `instance`, `corr=null`, `cli_version`, `cli_verified`, `exit_code`. Exit-1 causes use a distinct `detail` code: already-live, squatted-name, sha-256 mismatch, `.cmd`/`.bat` child, and for a start made by `viola revive` also no-session, session-live and cwd-missing. A revive whose instance check refuses writes no line: the check precedes the log (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor). No path or pid appears in the detail.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - Fail-open paths are logged to `hook-<name>.ndjson` only: oversize stdin, malformed JSON, channel failure, server-verify mismatch, strict-modes failure, missing `VIOLA_NAME`. As landed a strict-modes failure is not logged: `viola hook statusline` is the one arm that runs an instance check, and a refused check leaves no line (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor; the founder's own answer, 2026-10-13, relayed verbatim by the Viola overseer, the operator's answer at its planning superseded 2026-10-13).
  - A server-verify mismatch (Linux and Windows) is one `hook-decision{detail:"server-verify-failed"}` at WARN with no frame sent — on a dialog hook `hook-invoked{corr:null}` then `hook-decision{corr:null, decision_emitted:false, detail:"server-verify-failed"}` — and no pid, start time, path or endpoint in the line; macOS compares no peer pid (the recorded gap).
  - Exit is 0 and stderr stays empty.
  - Drift reports go to `diagnostics/` only.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - `diagnostics/` files are 0600 in 0700 directories (Windows: home DACL), enforced by the tests secret-scan test.
  - Refusal telemetry for strict-modes failures, pinned-exe hash mismatches and ignored symlinks. As landed a strict-modes failure has a line only on the `ledger-stamps` read in `run`'s version gate. Five strict-modes refusals leave no line: `viola revive`'s instance check, `viola hook statusline`'s instance check, `viola link` / `viola unlink`'s instance check of the driven instance (made before any role file opens; exit 21), the checked read of `budget.json` (`read_budget_stamped`, which the budget gate takes through `read_budget` and `viola list` takes directly, where a refused file is no reading) (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor), and `viola list`'s scan of the home, `instances/` and each instance, which refuses the whole board with exit 21 (chunk 2026-10-11-the-board-viola-list).

- **Required telemetry signal:** Fault telemetry per class:
  - torn ndjson line healed, with file and offset;
  - corrupt or unsupported-`v` snapshot → replay recovery;
  - child exit detected on the process handle without EOF (ConPTY);
  - endpoint vanished during `wait` (exit 21 / `instance-unreachable`);
  - stale heartbeat vs live pid.

  These need `event` values or an additive `detail` field (section 3, gap b).

- **Required telemetry signal:** A zero-unlogged-panics invariant for all four process roles. Each panic produces exactly one single-line `event:"panic"` record and no multi-line backtrace, and `hook` still exits 0. No formal latency or availability SLO beyond the tests perf gates.

- **Required telemetry signal:**
  - `release-from-driver` is its own logged event, not a generic -32602 wrapper fault.
  - Each cause behind exit 21 (dead instance, strict-mode fail, server-verify fail) and exit 1 (already live, squatted name, SHA-256 mismatch, `.cmd`/`.bat` child, and `viola revive`'s no logged session and missing recorded directory) gets a distinct `detail` code with no path or pid. `viola revive`'s strict-mode fail carries no logged `detail` as landed (no log line): its output is the stderr pair, or under `--json` the `{"v":1,"error":"strict-modes-failed","detail":null}` document (chunk 2026-10-17-cli-machine-contract), exit 1 (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor). `viola link` / `viola unlink`'s strict-mode fail (their instance check of the driven instance) carries no logged `detail` either (no line): its output is the fixed instance-state `unable` / `hint:` pair on stderr, or under `--json` the `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":null}` document, exit 21.
  - The server-verify fail is written on Linux and Windows as `process-exit{subject:"self", exit_code:21, detail:"server-verify-failed", during:"connect"}` in `cli-<name>.ndjson` by `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release`, `link` and `unlink` (for `link` / `unlink` the driven instance's file), distinct from `instance-dead`, with no pid, start time, path or endpoint; macOS writes none (no peer pid, the recorded gap).
