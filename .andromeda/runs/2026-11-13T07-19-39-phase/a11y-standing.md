# a11y · standing conventions

- S1 · every new or moved test runs as an ordinary nextest case in the existing suites; its failure is a nextest failure and the CI test gate allows no skip of it · bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · 1-a11y-scope-summary
  contract/structured-violation-json/suites-failures · Structured violation JSON · suites[].failures[] — Output-discipline failures of cli and tui surface only as nextest failures in suites[].failures[].
  decision/a11y-fail-fast-gate · A11y is a fail-fast gate — A11y is never skipped on CI failure: it is a FAIL-fast gate, not a warning.
  decision/a11y-failures-are-nextest-failures · a11y failures are nextest failures — An a11y failure surfaces only as a nextest failure in the harness run JSON, with no a11y violation rows and no a11y artifact of its own.
  decision/a11y-inside-existing-suites · A11y assertions inside existing suites — A11y and CLI output-discipline assertions run inside the existing nextest-integration, nextest-e2e and coverage suites; no new suite enum value such as a11y is added without a Decisions Log entry.
  decision/a11y-runs-in-existing-test-suites · a11y runs in the existing test suites — The CLI and TUI a11y cases are ordinary nextest cases in the test job's coverage suite, with no a11y gate, lint, aggregation, upload step, separate driver or suite value of their own.
  decision/ci-test-gate-no-skips · CI test gate allows no skips — The CI test job's gate requires coverage and doctest and never allows skips.
- S2 · every new test is deterministic — zero flakiness, no retries, and a gate breach fails the build · 10-slo-invariants-a11y-budgets
  decision/a11y-gate-breach-fails-build · Gate breach fails the build — A `gate --require coverage,doctest` breach (`suite-failed`, `suite-skipped`, `suite-missing`, `artifact-missing`) fails the build and deploy.
  decision/no-soft-a11y-slo · No soft a11y SLO — An a11y SLO is never soft: it triggers a build or deploy failure on its threshold.
  decision/zero-flakiness · Zero flakiness, no retries — Tests and a11y checks run with `retries: 0` and `#[ignore]` banned; a flake keeps the work red until its root cause is fixed. · why: retry-once policies mask real signals (the agent-driven principle)
- S3 · new checks run inside the coverage suite of the push/PR workflow, with no separate driver, suite value or artifact of their own · 9-ci-integration
  decision/a11y-cases-inside-coverage-suite · A11y cases run inside the coverage suite — The CLI output-discipline and TUI boundary cases run inside the test job's single instrumented `coverage` suite on the `ubuntu-latest` leg, and its `gate --require coverage,doctest` is the verdict. · why: a11y CI runs in the same pipeline as the tests, under the binding 5-command discipline of the test harness contract
  decision/a11y-ci-github-actions · A11y checks in the GitHub Actions push/PR workflow — A11y checks run in the one GitHub Actions push/PR workflow on an `ubuntu-latest` matrix; the scheduled nightly workflow carries no a11y step.
  decision/cli-invariants-pass-in-ci · CLI output-discipline invariants pass in CI — The CLI output-discipline invariants (P4, P6) pass on the `ubuntu-latest` CI leg inside the `coverage` suite.
  decision/no-a11y-performance-budget · No performance budget per a11y CI run — A11y CI has no performance budget of its own: the cli and tui cases add no stage, running inside the `coverage` suite.
  decision/no-own-a11y-artifact · No a11y artifact of its own — A11y uploads no artifact of its own: a cli or tui failure is a nextest failure in the harness `run` JSON `suites[].failures[]`.
  decision/no-separate-a11y-driver · No separate a11y driver or suite value — A11y adds no second driver outside the harness `run` command and no new `suite` value such as `a11y`.
- S4 · the CI gate a new test joins requires coverage and doctest to pass alongside it · ci-integration
  decision/gate-requires-coverage-doctest · Gate requires coverage and doctest — The test job runs the harness and then gate --require coverage,doctest, with skips never allowed.
