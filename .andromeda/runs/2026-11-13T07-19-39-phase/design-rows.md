## brand-identity · ## Brand Identity
decision/run-prints-nothing-while-wrapped · viola run silent while wrapped — `viola run` prints nothing at all while the wrapped `claude` TUI runs, and neither does a `viola revive` that passed its preflight.
contract/cli-verification/unverified-cli · CLI verification state · unverified-cli — An unstamped CLI build runs transport only, shown as `unverified-cli`.
contract/cli-verification/verified · CLI verification state · verified — A CLI version stamped by `viola verify` prints `verified`.
contract/handoff/transfer-marker · Handoff display · transfer marker — Transfer of control is shown as a `driver -> driven` transfer marker.

## iconography · ## Iconography
contract/cli-glyphs/arrow · CLI glyphs · -> — The arrow glyph is `->`, with no inbound form.
contract/cli-transfer-arrow/ascii-arrow · CLI transfer arrows · -> — The CLI prints transfers with ASCII `->` and has no inbound form; links print only as `link` / `unlink` verb output (`overseer -> builder`).
contract/cli-separators/two-spaces · CLI separators · two spaces — Two spaces separate columns, and a refusal's reason from its detail, as separate fields.

## surface-cli · ## Surface: cli · twin surface
decision/ascii-mirror-words-always-print · ASCII mirror marks are words, not glyphs — A glyph is a non-ASCII symbol; the ASCII readback mirror `[RB]` / `[  ]` / `[/ ]` and `->` are words that print in every human output, piped, `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb` included, and only `--json` replaces them with its JSON document.
decision/json-one-document-on-stdout · --json result is one stdout document — Under `--json` the whole result, refusals and `error` objects included, is one JSON document on stdout with the typed exit code. · except: an oversize `viola answer` and an unusable `viola send` exit 2 with their fixed stderr line, no document; a `pump_child` error under `viola revive --json` prints none, the child holding the terminal
decision/list-refuses-board-on-strict-modes-failure · Strict-modes failure refuses the whole board — A failed strict-modes check of the home or any instance refuses the whole list board with exit 21, in the fixed unable and hint pair or, under --json, the instance-unreachable document with detail strict-modes-failed. · why: The MCP list tool reads the same refusal document through the shared board reader, and the list tests pin exit 21 and the document byte for byte.
decision/no-hint-for-faults · No hint for faults and unknown — `error: wrapper fault` (exit 20), `error: internal error` (exit 1) and `unknown` (exit 14) print no hint line; a fault's human line holds the code only and further detail goes to `diagnostics/`. · why: Faults are not refusals; the detail of `unknown` is a code word or nothing, so a hint would have to guess.
decision/no-hint-under-json · No hint line under --json — No `hint:` line is printed under `--json`; the typed `refusal` / `error` fields and their `detail` are the whole answer, exit 21's cause being its `detail`.
decision/silent-catch-sites · Silent catch sites — At the catch site, `run`, `revive`'s start, `mcp` and `hook` stay silent.
decision/step-counter-only-progress-pattern · Step counter as the one progress pattern — The step counter of `verify` is the project's one progress pattern.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/viola-hook · CLI colour decision order · viola hook — Third match of the colour decision order: `viola hook` prints no colour, glyph or SGR and never writes stderr.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/viola-mcp · CLI colour decision order · viola mcp — Third match of the colour decision order: `viola mcp` prints no colour, glyph or SGR, and its stdout carries MCP frames only.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/viola-run · CLI colour decision order · viola run — Second match of the colour decision order: under `viola run` no colour, glyph or SGR is printed, and while the child runs nothing is printed at all.
contract/cli-exit-codes/0 · CLI exit codes · 0 — No stderr first word (TTY context lines only); the result line goes to stdout; under `--json` the document `{"v":1,"ok":{…}}`.
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · CLI exit codes · 1 — `error: internal error` (fixed; no chain, paths or hint), or a fixed `unable:` refusal of `run`, `revive` or `verify` with its hint; `--json` only for `revive`'s shared-start refusals and the catch site's `{"v":1,"error":"internal-error","detail":null}`, stderr empty.
contract/cli-exit-codes/10-14 · CLI exit codes · 10 to 14 — An `unable` refusal with its reason; a refusal object under `--json`.
contract/cli-exit-codes/2 · CLI exit codes · 2 — Clap usage text (never from `viola hook`), or the fixed `UNUSABLE_RESPONSE` line (oversize `viola answer`) or `UNUSABLE_TEXT` line (unusable `viola send`) on stderr, whatever `--json` says; no document.
contract/cli-exit-codes/20 · CLI exit codes · 20 — `error: wrapper fault  <code>`; under `--json` `{"v":1,"error":"wrapper-fault","detail":{…}}`.
contract/cli-exit-codes/21 · CLI exit codes · 21 — `unable  instance-unreachable` then the cause's hint; strict-modes refusals print the fixed home-state or instance-state `unable:` / `hint:` pair instead, with no frame; under `--json` `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"<cause>"}`, stderr empty.
contract/cli-message-escaping/control-characters · CLI message-mode escaping · control characters — In `wait`, `last` and a non-RFC 3339 `since` of `viola link`, every decoded control character (C0, DEL, C1) except `\n` and `\t` prints as `\xHH`, two uppercase hex digits; nothing is stripped.
contract/cli-message-escaping/json · CLI message-mode escaping · --json — `--json` output stays serde-escaped.
contract/cli-refusal-line/fixed-unable-form · CLI refusal line · fixed unable form — The exit-1 refusals of `run`, `revive` and `verify` and the exit-21 strict-modes refusals of `list`, `link`, `unlink`, `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause` and `release` print the fixed `unable: <text>` form.
contract/cli-streams/stderr · CLI streams · stderr — stderr carries context lines, refusals with each refusal's `hint:` line directly after it, and errors.
contract/cli-streams/stdout · CLI streams · stdout — stdout carries results and data: tables, send/wait results, `last` text.
contract/cli-strict-modes-refusal/instance-state-pair · CLI strict-modes refusal · instance-state pair — The exit-21 strict-modes refusal of `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause` and `release` prints the fixed instance-state `unable:` / `hint:` pair, not the `[/ ]` mirror.
contract/cli-verb-output/link · CLI verb output · viola link — `viola link <a> <b>` prints `link    <a> -> <b>  since <time>`, or `link    <a> -> <b>  already linked` for an existing pair.
contract/cli-verb-output/unlink · CLI verb output · viola unlink — `viola unlink <a> <b>` prints `unlink  <a> -> <b>`.
contract/exit-21-cause/strict-modes-failed · exit 21 cause · strict-modes-failed — One of the closed set of causes named in exit 21's `detail`.
contract/help-output/verb-groups · viola --help output · verb groups — `viola --help` lists the served verbs as `board: list` / `traffic: send, wait, last, answer` / `wheel: pause, release` / `handoff: link, unlink` / `setup: run, revive, verify, plugin install`, then `Options:`.
contract/hook-verb/exit-code · The hook verb · exit code — `hook` always exits 0.
contract/hook-verb/stderr · The hook verb · stderr — `hook` writes nothing to stderr.
contract/mcp-verb/stdout · The mcp verb · stdout — `mcp` writes only MCP frames on stdout.
contract/strict-modes-refusal/exit-21 · Instance strict-modes refusal · exit 21 — A refused strict-modes check of the driven instance by `viola link` / `unlink`, or of the instance of `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause` and `release`, is made before any frame, exits 21, and writes no frame and no line.
contract/strict-modes-refusal/human-output · Instance strict-modes refusal · unable: / hint: pair — The refusal prints the instance-state `unable:` / `hint:` pair naming that instance, as `viola list`'s does.
contract/strict-modes-refusal/json-document · Instance strict-modes refusal · --json document — Under `--json` the refusal prints the `instance-unreachable` document with `detail` `strict-modes-failed`, and stderr stays empty.
contract/viola-run-output/child-started · viola run and revive output · child started — `run` and `revive` print nothing once the child starts.
contract/viola-verify-output/stamps-refused · viola verify output · stamps.json update refused — A `stamps.json` update refused by its strict-modes check prints the home-state `unable:` / `hint:` pair.
contract/viola-verify-output/step-line · viola verify output · step line — One static appended uncoloured stdout line per relied ledger row, ending `pass` or `fail`, counted against `MM`, the relied count.
contract/viola-verify-output/stopped-or-refused · viola verify output · stopped or refused run — A run stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM before its rows are checked, or refused by its home tree's strict-modes check before its log, prints no step line and no summary, only its fixed `unable:` / `hint:` pair, and exits 1.
contract/viola-verify-output/summary · viola verify output · summary — A summary line `stamped <ver>  <n> pass  <m> fail` follows, n + m being the relied count.
decision/clap-without-colour-feature · clap built without its colour feature — Argument parsing uses clap (derive) built without its `color` feature, so clap's help and usage output is plain in every mode and no dependency reads a colour or terminal variable. · why: every styled byte of human output is viola's own SGR module's
decision/linux-terminal-platform · Linux terminals as the CLI platform — The cli targets Linux terminals: the core on any current distribution, CI on `ubuntu-latest`.
decision/list-is-the-board · viola list is the board — `viola list` is the board, `verify` and `plugin install` act on no strip, and every other verb a person runs acts on one strip.
decision/start-refusals-show-no-path-or-pid · Start refusals show no path or pid — The exit-1 refusals of `viola run` and `viola revive` print one fixed-message line and one hint per cause, and none shows a path, a pid, the recorded directory or a logged id.
decision/tty-detection-std-isterminal · TTY detection by std IsTerminal — TTY detection uses std `IsTerminal`.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/json · CLI colour decision order · --json — First match of the colour decision order: `--json` output has no colour, no glyph and no SGR.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/no-color · CLI colour decision order · NO_COLOR — Fourth match of the colour decision order: with `NO_COLOR` set (present, an empty value included) output has no colour, no glyph and no SGR.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/stdout-not-terminal · CLI colour decision order · stdout is not a terminal — Sixth match of the colour decision order: when stdout is not a terminal output has no colour, no glyph and no SGR.
contract/cli-colour-decision-order/term-dumb · CLI colour decision order · TERM=dumb — Fifth match of the colour decision order: with `TERM=dumb` output has no colour, no glyph and no SGR.
contract/cli-refusal-line/hint · CLI refusal line · hint — A refusal is followed directly by one `hint:` line per reason, detail or cause.
contract/cli-start-refusal/fixed-message · run and revive start refusals · fixed message — A start refusal of `run` or `revive` prints a fixed-message `unable:` line and one hint per cause; `revive`'s causes are read in a fixed order that stops at the first.
contract/cli-strict-modes-refusal/plugin-install · CLI strict-modes refusal · viola plugin install — A refused strict-modes check of `viola plugin install` exits 21 with the home-state `unable:` / `hint:` pair as `viola list`'s does, or under `--json` the `instance-unreachable` document with `detail` `strict-modes-failed`, stderr empty.
contract/cli-surface/output-streams · CLI surface · stdout/stderr — The cli surface is the stdout and stderr of the `viola` binary.
contract/exit-21-cause/endpoint-lost · exit 21 cause · endpoint-lost — One of the closed set of causes named in exit 21's `detail`.
contract/exit-21-cause/instance-dead · exit 21 cause · instance-dead — One of the closed set of causes named in exit 21's `detail`.

contract/viola-revive-output/json-refusal · viola revive output · --json refusal — Under `--json` every refusal of the start `revive` shares with `run` prints one exit-1 stdout document `{"v":1,"error":"<code>","detail":null}` and no hint, stderr empty; `run` itself prints none of these documents; a `pump_child` error prints none.

## surface · ## Surface: cli · twin surface-cli
decision/cli-colour-amber-and-dim-only · CLI colour limited to amber and dim — CLI output colours nothing but the `DIALOG` word and `stale` rows, so no blue or other colour SGR is ever emitted. · why: The quiz limits CLI colour to amber and dim.
decision/hints-human-mode-only · Hints in human mode only — Hints print in human mode only; under `--json` no hint text is printed and the machine view carries the cause as a detail code, never as prose.
decision/instance-unreachable-hint-per-cause · One instance-unreachable hint per cause — The `instance-unreachable` refusal (exit 21) prints one hint per cause. · why: The exit code is shared by several causes.
decision/json-failure-documents-clean · Clean --json failure documents — Each CLI `--json` failure prints one document, exits its literal code, leaves stderr empty, and holds no ESC, no path and no upstream text. · guard: tests/cli_error_bodies.rs
decision/one-progress-pattern · One progress pattern — A step counter with static appended stdout lines is the project's one progress pattern.
contract/cli-catch-site/json-flag-scope · CLI catch site · --json flag scope — The catch site counts `--json` only among the arguments before a `--`, read from argv.
contract/cli-catch-site/json-internal-error · CLI catch site · --json internal error — Under `--json` the catch site prints the `internal-error` document on stdout in place of `error: internal error`, stderr then empty; without `--json` it prints that line, byte for byte.
contract/cli-catch-site/silent-verbs · CLI catch site · silent verbs — `run`, `revive`'s start, `mcp` and `hook` stay silent at the catch site, under `--json` too.
contract/cli-colour-tokens/handoff-blue · CLI colour tokens · handoff blue — Handoff blue #5B8DB8 is not used at any colour depth and no index is reserved for it; link output (`overseer -> builder`) is plain.
contract/cli-exit-codes/10 · CLI exit codes · 10 — `unable  human-typing` (+ `manual-pause`); under `--json` `{"v":1,"refusal":"human-typing","detail":…}`.
contract/cli-exit-codes/11 · CLI exit codes · 11 — `unable  budget-paused  five-hour` or `seven-day`; under `--json` the refusal object.
contract/cli-exit-codes/12 · CLI exit codes · 12 — `unable  unverified-cli`; under `--json` the refusal object.
contract/cli-exit-codes/13 · CLI exit codes · 13 — `unable  not-delivered` with `input-not-ready`, `no-prompt-submitted`, `turn-running`, `unknown-dialog`, `control-character` or `empty-text`; under `--json` the refusal object.
contract/cli-exit-codes/14 · CLI exit codes · 14 — `unable  unknown  <detail>`, the detail a code word or nothing; under `--json` the refusal object.
contract/cli-stderr/error-line · CLI stderr · error line — Errors print on stderr as `error: …`.
contract/cli-stderr/fixed-message-refusal · CLI stderr · fixed message form — The exit-1 refusals of `viola run`, `revive` and `verify`, `viola list`'s exit-21 strict-modes refusal, and the exit-21 strict-modes refusals of `link`, `unlink`, `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause` and `release` use `unable: <text>`.
contract/exit-21-json-cause/server-verify-failed · exit 21 --json causes · server-verify-failed — A process on the endpoint that is not the recorded wrapper (pid or start time differs, the check cannot be made, or the peer's euid is not this user's or cannot be read) gets no frame; the eight frame-writing verbs read `server-verify-failed`.
contract/exit-21-json-cause/strict-modes-failed · exit 21 --json causes · strict-modes-failed — The `list`, `link`, `unlink` and `plugin install` refusals and the six frame verbs' strict-modes refusals read `strict-modes-failed`.
contract/fixed-refusal-pairs/home-state · fixed refusal pairs · home-state pair — `unable: the viola home is not private to you` then `hint: the viola home must be readable only by you; viola does not change its permissions`.
contract/fixed-refusal-pairs/instance-state · fixed refusal pairs · instance-state pair — `unable: <name>'s state files can be written by another user` then `hint: viola will not read them; make the viola home and its files owner-only`, naming the instance checked.
contract/refusal-hints/unverified-cli · refusal hints · unverified-cli — `run viola verify for this CLI version`
contract/strict-modes/home-under-regular-file · strict-modes refusals · home under a regular file — A home under a regular file cannot be read and is a strict-modes refusal, not the catch-site line: `verify` prints the home-state pair (exit 1), the frame verbs the instance-state pair (exit 21).
contract/viola-link-json/ok · viola link --json · ok — Exit 0 prints `{"v":1,"ok":{"since":<ts>,"already_linked":<bool>}}`, `<ts>` the time the wrapper recorded the link.
contract/viola-link-output/printed-names · viola link and unlink output · printed names — The names printed are the verb's own parsed arguments, never names read back from the reply or the log.
contract/viola-link-output/refused-pair · viola link and unlink output · refused pair — A pair the wrapper refuses (`-32602`; a `driver` equal to `driven`, which the CLI never refuses itself) exits 20: `error: wrapper fault  <code>`, or under `--json` the `wrapper-fault` document.
contract/viola-link-output/repeat-link · viola link and unlink output · repeat link — A second `viola link` of a held pair prints the `already linked` form, the wrapper keeping the first `since`, and exits 0.
contract/viola-link-output/result-line · viola link and unlink output · result line — `viola link` and `viola unlink` print one result line on stdout in one write, plain ASCII with no SGR whatever the terminal, and exit 0.
contract/viola-link-output/since · viola link and unlink output · since — The `link` line's `since` is the reply's `since` as UTC clock time in whole seconds with `Z` (`HH:MM:SSZ`); a `since` that is no RFC 3339 instant prints through the message-mode escaper.
contract/viola-link-output/unlink-not-held · viola link and unlink output · unlink of a pair not held — `viola unlink` of a pair that is not held prints the same `unlink  <driver> -> <driven>` line and exits 0.
contract/viola-list-board/json-refusal · viola list board · --json refusal — Under `--json` the strict-modes refusal, the board's only one, is one stdout document `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}`, stderr empty.
contract/viola-list-board/strict-modes-refusal · viola list board · strict-modes refusal — A failed strict-modes check of the home, `instances/` or any one instance refuses the whole board with exit 21, nothing from state printed, in the fixed `unable:` / `hint:` form.
contract/viola-list-board/strict-modes-scan · viola list board · strict-modes scan — The scan holds the home to the read rule and `instances/` to the write rule, then each instance's set; a home another user may read refuses the whole board with the home-state pair, with or without an instance.
contract/viola-revive-json-codes/strict-modes-failed · viola revive --json exit-1 codes · strict-modes-failed — `strict-modes-failed` is one of the closed exit-1 codes of `viola revive --json`.
contract/viola-revive-refusals/home-tree-check · viola revive refusals · home-tree check — The home-tree check of its start, after a passed preflight and before any log, with no child, prints the home-state or instance-state pair, or under `--json` the `strict-modes-failed` document.
contract/viola-revive-refusals/strict-modes-no-log · viola revive refusals · strict-modes — `viola revive`'s strict-modes refusal writes no log line and carries no logged detail code: the stderr pair, or under `--json` the `strict-modes-failed` document, and exit 1.
contract/viola-run-start-refusals/home-tree-check · viola run start refusals · home-tree check — At start, before any log and with no child, the home, `ledger/`, `bin/`, `plugin/`, the pinned copy and its `plugin/<key>/` are checked, each that exists; a home-level refusal prints the home-state pair, an instance-level one the instance-state pair.
contract/viola-unlink-json/ok · viola unlink --json · ok — Exit 0 prints `{"v":1,"ok":{}}`.
contract/viola-verify-output/fail-word · viola verify output · fail word — The word `fail` is uncoloured.
contract/viola-verify-output/help · viola verify output · --help — `viola verify --help` carries one static ASCII paragraph naming no path: run it from a folder you trust in Claude Code, and an unapproved external CLAUDE.md import blocks the probe.
contract/viola-verify-output/summary-line · viola verify output · summary line — The last stdout line is a summary whose counts add up to `MM`: `stamped <version>  <n> pass  <m> fail`; a failing row prints no stderr word.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/cli-not-found · viola verify refusals · CLI not found — `unable: the claude CLI was not found`, followed by its own hint, exit 1.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/home-tree-check · viola verify refusals · home-tree check — Before its log, `verify` checks the home, `ledger/`, `bin/` and `plugin/`, each that exists; a refusal prints no step line and no summary, only the home-state pair, and exits 1.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/interrupted · viola verify refusals · interrupted run — A run stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM before its rows are checked prints no step line and no summary; stderr carries exactly `unable: verify was stopped before it finished` then `hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI`; exit 1.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/stamps-update · viola verify refusals · stamps.json update — A `stamps.json` update refused by its strict-modes check prints the home-state pair and exits 1.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/unclean-fixture · viola verify refusals · unclean fixture — `unable: a recorded fixture is not clean: <file> <code>` (a screen: `<file> row <n>[ seam] <code>`), codes `home-path` · `absolute-path` · `username` · `email`, never the content, followed by its hint, exit 1.
contract/viola-verify-refusals/version-unreadable · viola verify refusals · version unreadable — `unable: the CLI version could not be read`, followed by its own hint, exit 1.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/message · wrapper fault --json detail · message — Exit 20's `--json` `detail` is closed for the five known codes, and `message` is each code's fixed text.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/other-invalid-params · wrapper fault --json detail · other -32602 — Any other `-32602` reads `invalid params` with null `data`.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/other-known-codes · wrapper fault --json detail · other known codes — Every known code other than `-32602` has null `data`.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/release-from-driver · wrapper fault --json detail · -32602 release-from-driver — `-32602` with `data.reason` exactly `release-from-driver` reads that body.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/unknown-code · wrapper fault --json detail · code outside the five — A code outside the five known prints `error: wrapper fault  <code>`, and under `--json` `{"v":1,"error":"wrapper-fault","detail":{"code":<code>,"message":"wrapper fault","data":null}}`; MCP carries the same fixed `message`.
contract/wrapper-fault-detail/unsupported-version · wrapper fault --json detail · -32602 unsupported version — `-32602` with an integer `data.supported` and a version-text `data.wrapper` reads the unsupported-version body with those two values.
contract/wrapper-socket/refused-peer · wrapper socket · refused peer — A peer the wrapper refuses is dropped before any frame: no line written, nothing on the terminal the child holds, no wheel moved; the client reads end-of-file.
decision/no-hint-for-unknown · No hint for unknown — The `unknown` refusal (exit 14) prints no hint line. · why: Its detail is a code word or nothing, and a hint would have to guess.
decision/no-hint-names-viola-release · No hint names viola release — No refusal hint ever names `viola release`; `release` stays a human verb. · why: The human-typing and budget-paused refusals reach drivers, and a driver's `release` is refused (`-32602`, `release-from-driver`, exit 20).
decision/no-json-after-child-held-terminal · No document once the child held the terminal — An error while pumping the child under `viola revive --json` prints no document. · why: The child has held the terminal and viola writes nothing past it.
decision/terminal-background-never-set · Terminal background never set — The CLI never sets a background colour, at any colour depth. · why: The terminal background belongs to the user.
contract/cli-stderr/context-lines · CLI stderr · context lines — Context lines (`waiting: <name>`, the issue line of a send) go to stderr.
contract/cli-stderr/hint-line · CLI stderr · hint line — Each refusal's `hint:` line follows it directly on stderr.
contract/exit-21-json-cause/instance-dead · exit 21 --json causes · instance-dead — With no live endpoint, an instance directory that is a directory reads `instance-dead`, as do a failed connect and a frame verb against a stale instance; stale heartbeat is exit 1's cause alone.
contract/exit-21-json-cause/unwrapped-name · exit 21 --json causes · unwrapped-name — With no live endpoint, a frame verb whose instance directory, read after the strict-modes check, is absent, a regular file or a symlink reads `unwrapped-name`.
contract/frame-verb-refusals/strict-modes · frame verb refusals · strict-modes — A failed strict-modes check (`send` after reading its text; `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release` first; each before any frame) prints the instance-state pair, no `unable  instance-unreachable` line or mirror; `--json`: the `strict-modes-failed` document.
contract/log-detail-codes/server-verify-failed · log detail codes · server-verify-failed — Written to the log by `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release`, `link` and `unlink` at their exit-21 server-verification refusal, whose `--json` document reads the same word.
contract/log-detail-codes/socket-dir-refused · log detail codes · socket-dir-refused — Written to the log by `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release`, `link` and `unlink` at their exit-21 socket-directory refusal, and at `run`'s and `revive`'s start.
contract/peer-reply-screening/code-word · peer reply screening · code word — A code word is 1 to 64 bytes of lower-case letters, digits and hyphens, a lower-case letter first; both clients, the CLI and the MCP server, screen a peer's `refusal` and `detail` through it.
contract/peer-reply-screening/non-string-detail · peer reply screening · non-string detail — A peer reply with a non-string `detail` is no known reply.
contract/peer-reply-screening/string-detail-not-code-word · peer reply screening · string detail that is no code word — A peer's string `detail` that is no code word reads as no detail, null under `--json`.

## anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
decision/no-internals-in-errors · No internals in errors or hints — Errors and hints never print upstream text, paths, pids or anyhow chains with serde sources. · why: The security plan's NEVER-log floor.
decision/no-spinners-in-verb-output · No spinners in verb output — A verb's output has no spinner, progress bar or live-redrawing dashboard; `wait` prints one static `waiting:` line and `verify` prints step-counter lines. · why: A spinner is progress presumed before it is confirmed.
decision/plain-output-modes · Plain output modes — No colour, glyphs, cursor control or spinner are emitted under `--json`, non-TTY, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, `viola run`, or a passed `viola revive`. · why: LLM drivers parse this output, and `viola run`'s terminal belongs to the child's screen.
decision/stdout-data-stderr-messages · Data on stdout, messages on stderr — Results go to stdout; `waiting:`, refusals with their `hint:` lines, and errors go to stderr.
decision/confirmations-carry-context · Confirmations carry context — Output never says "done" or "success" bare; it says what was read back, by whom, and at which cursor.
decision/no-check-glyph-or-emoji-prefixes · No check-mark or emoji prefixes — Output never uses green check / red cross prefixes or emoji; the readback mirror `[RB]` / `[  ]` / `[/ ]` and the words `read back` / `unable` are the prefixes.
