## design-philosophy · ## Design Philosophy
decision/no-tmux-or-shell-dependency · No dependence on tmux or a shell — No design choice may depend on tmux or a shell.

## stack-and-technologies · ## Stack and Technologies
decision/typed-errors-per-crate · thiserror per crate, anyhow at the bin edge — Each crate has typed errors callers can branch on through thiserror; anyhow is used at the bin edge only. · except: viola-pty's error type is hand-written

## established-decisions · ## Established Decisions
decision/ci-against-fake-agent · CI on ubuntu-latest against the fake agent — GitHub Actions on `ubuntu-latest` runs the tests against the fake agent; the real CLI runs only in local live tests. · why: No tokens spent, no flakes in CI, and no cross-compilers (cross 0.2.5 is stale).

## conventions · ## Conventions
decision/unparseable-external-values-unknown · Unparseable external values become unknown — An unparseable external value becomes the string `"unknown"` in viola's own records, never an error, covering `resets_at`, `used_percentage` and a missing statusline window. · except: A hyprctl reply the Hyprland seam cannot parse is the seam's malformed error.

## standard-contracts · ## Standard Contracts
decision/hyprctl-direct-spawn · hyprctl spawned directly with a closed argv — hyprctl is spawned directly from a caller-resolved path, with no shell and no PATH lookup, stdin null and a closed argv; a dispatch is the Lua form hl.dsp.focus whose only inserted value is a closed window address or an i32 workspace id, never reply text. · why: Hyprland 0.56.2 runs a dispatch's arguments as Lua, so only the measured hl.dsp.focus form is accepted.
decision/no-shell-out · No shelling out — Nothing shells out through `sh` or `bash`; child processes are spawned directly. · except: `hook statusline` runs the user's own statusline command, read at start from one named source, through `/bin/sh -c` with the same stdin.
contract/hyprland-seam-errors/oversize · Hyprland seam errors · oversize — The reply passed the frame cap and was refused whole before the exit was read; the fixed message hyprctl reply over the frame cap interpolates nothing.
contract/hyprland-seam-errors/refused · Hyprland seam errors · refused — hyprctl refused a dispatch; the fixed message hyprctl refused the dispatch interpolates nothing.
contract/hyprland-seam-errors/malformed · Hyprland seam errors · malformed — The reply could not be parsed for its request; the fixed message hyprctl reply not understood interpolates nothing.

## cross-cutting-patterns · ## Cross-cutting Patterns
decision/bounded-readers · Bounded readers at every boundary — Every product reader of external bytes is bounded in its own statement or named as an exception; none reads an external byte source to its end unbounded. · guard: contract_bounded_readers: product_readers_are_each_bounded_or_named · except: The own-executable reads, which are no external input.

## ci-cd-approach · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/mutation-at-epoch-boundary · Mutation testing at the epoch boundary — CI runs no mutation job; mutation testing runs only through the harness mutants run, kept for the epoch-boundary code audit.
decision/real-claude-local-only · Real claude CLI only locally — The real claude CLI runs only locally, never in CI; in CI viola verify runs only against the fake agent, and its real-CLI probe and record run only locally. · guard: tests/cli_verify.rs

## crate-dependency-direction · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/hyprland-seam-crate · viola-hyprland is the one compositor seam — Compositor queries and dispatches go only through viola-hyprland's closed request set; the crate is sync and tokio-free and depends on viola-core alone among viola crates, never on viola-agent-claude, viola-state or viola-channel. · guard: the cargo tree check of viola-hyprland and the per-sync-crate tokio ban

absence/model-api-calls — Calling any model API; viola drives the unmodified claude CLI on the user's subscription
overview/stack-and-technologies — viola is one native Rust binary: a std-thread core with Tokio built only inside `mcp`, clap for the CLI, portable-pty behind viola's own `pty` seam, vt100 for readiness, interprocess local sockets carrying JSON-RPC 2.0 over ndjson, ndjson append logs and atomically replaced JSON snapshots with no database, broker, container or hosting, rmcp for the stdio MCP server, and GitHub Actions on `ubuntu-latest` against the fake agent.

## project-intent · ## Project Intent
absence/web-or-graphical-frontend — A web or graphical frontend
overview/project-intent — viola is a hybrid local developer tool that lets one interactive Claude Code session drive another on the user's own subscription. It has a native Linux CLI binary and a Claude Code plugin of hooks and a stdio MCP server that calls that binary; a keyboard-driven terminal fleet console is planned, not built. It wraps the unmodified claude CLI in a PTY, types at turn boundaries, answers dialogs through hooks, and holds a one-driver wheel the human can take at any moment. It is a modular monolith: one binary with internal crates around core, and no daemon.
