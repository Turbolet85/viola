# a11y-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-14-hyprland-exact-frame-bound-pinned — picked 17 of 241 (8 by every draw) · rule any · pin 1075

## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
decision/no-assertions-for-internal-crates · Internal crates not assertable — The internal crates of the modular monolith are not-assertable and carry no assertions. · why: library-only, with no UI surface
decision/a11y-inside-existing-suites · A11y assertions inside existing suites — A11y and CLI output-discipline assertions run inside the existing nextest-integration, nextest-e2e and coverage suites; no new suite enum value such as a11y is added without a Decisions Log entry.
decision/ci-test-gate-no-skips · CI test gate allows no skips — The CI test job's gate requires coverage and doctest and never allows skips.

## 8-cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin cognitive-accessibility
decision/time-bounds-never-on-human · Time bounds never fall on the human — Every time bound viola holds (wait timeout and cap, dialog hold, send readiness gate, confirmation windows, status-line deadline, agents read, budget pause) falls on the driver, the user's command or viola's child; no key is blocked, refused or delayed by it.

## cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin 8-cognitive-accessibility
decision/time-bounds-fall-on-the-driver · Time bounds fall on the driver only — Every time bound (MCP wait cap, dialog hold, readiness gate, confirm windows, budget pause, statusline deadline, agents read) falls on the driver or viola's own child, never blocking, refusing or delaying a human key and never moving the wheel.
decision/client-euid-refusal-test-strategy · Client euid refusal test strategy — No foreign peer is driven: the client euid refusal's decision is tested over injected euids and its real read on Linux, and each client seam's wiring is read only by forced refusals in remove-the-guard runs.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration
decision/a11y-cases-inside-coverage-suite · A11y cases run inside the coverage suite — The CLI output-discipline and TUI boundary cases run inside the test job's single instrumented `coverage` suite on the `ubuntu-latest` leg, and its `gate --require coverage,doctest` is the verdict. · why: a11y CI runs in the same pipeline as the tests, under the binding 5-command discipline of the test harness contract
decision/no-separate-a11y-driver · No separate a11y driver or suite value — A11y adds no second driver outside the harness `run` command and no new `suite` value such as `a11y`.

## 10-slo-invariants-a11y-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & A11y Budgets
decision/a11y-gate-breach-fails-build · Gate breach fails the build — A `gate --require coverage,doctest` breach (`suite-failed`, `suite-skipped`, `suite-missing`, `artifact-missing`) fails the build and deploy.
decision/mutation-audit-covers-crate-invariants · Mutation audit covers invariants held in crate tests — Where the CLI output-discipline invariants (P4, P6) live in crate tests, the epoch-boundary mutation audit (`run --mutants`) covers them.
decision/zero-flakiness · Zero flakiness, no retries — Tests and a11y checks run with `retries: 0` and `#[ignore]` banned; a flake keeps the work red until its root cause is fixed. · why: retry-once policies mask real signals (the agent-driven principle)
decision/cli-invariants-pass-in-ci · CLI output-discipline invariants pass in CI — The CLI output-discipline invariants (P4, P6) pass on the `ubuntu-latest` CI leg inside the `coverage` suite.

## 11-a11y-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. A11y Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
decision/a11y-fail-fast-gate · A11y is a fail-fast gate — A11y is never skipped on CI failure: it is a FAIL-fast gate, not a warning.

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/a11y-failures-are-nextest-failures · a11y failures are nextest failures — An a11y failure surfaces only as a nextest failure in the harness run JSON, with no a11y violation rows and no a11y artifact of its own.
decision/a11y-runs-in-existing-test-suites · a11y runs in the existing test suites — The CLI and TUI a11y cases are ordinary nextest cases in the test job's coverage suite, with no a11y gate, lint, aggregation, upload step, separate driver or suite value of their own.

## ci-integration · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/gate-requires-coverage-doctest · Gate requires coverage and doctest — The test job runs the harness and then gate --require coverage,doctest, with skips never allowed.

## keyboard-test-harness · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/live-readings-never-gate · Live readings never gate — Live readings of the takeover clause on a real terminal are supplemental and never gating.
