## threat-model-summary · ## Threat Model Summary
decision/cargo-deny-gate · Cargo deny gate on the root graph — Cargo dependencies are held to cargo deny check over the root lockfile: advisories, licences, sources and C-crate, telemetry-crate and feature bans. · guard: cargo deny check · except: the test-only fuzz workspace sits outside it by a ratified exemption, its lockfile getting its own advisory and source audit
decision/child-output-tolerant · Child output parsed tolerantly — Output of spawned children is parsed tolerantly, and a failure becomes unknown or a closed failure word.
decision/child-output-tolerant-unknown · Child output parsing fails to unknown — Child output parsing is tolerant, and a failure becomes unknown or a closed failure word.
decision/ci-no-secrets-no-real-claude · CI holds no secrets — CI holds no secrets and never runs the real claude CLI, which runs only locally.
decision/mutation-testing-at-audit · Mutation testing at the epoch audit — No CI job runs mutation testing; it belongs to the epoch-boundary code audit.
decision/real-cli-local-only · Real claude CLI only locally — The real claude CLI runs only locally; in CI viola verify runs only against the fake agent, and its real-CLI probe and record only locally.
decision/release-build-no-test-binaries · Release build refuses test-only binaries — The CI release build refuses any test-only binary. · guard: scripts/release-check.sh
decision/sync-crate-tokio-ban · No tokio in sync crates — tokio is banned from the sync crates.
decision/sync-crates-tokio-free · Sync crates free of tokio — A tokio ban holds per sync crate, and the channel crate's Tokio client sits behind its tokio feature. · guard: deny-sync.toml; scripts/channel-tokio-free.sh
decision/child-path-trust · Child processes trust PATH — Spawned child processes are whatever the calling process's PATH resolves to.
decision/upstream-text-is-content · Upstream text is content, never commands — Upstream text is treated as content, never as commands; viola does not interpret it, and a permission decision rests with the driver model outside viola. · why: mechanism, not policy

## input-validation · ## Input Validation
decision/bounded-readers-census · Every product reader bounded or named — Every product reader call is bounded in its statement or named as an exception, and each external boundary's bounded read has a named witness. · guard: product_readers_are_each_bounded_or_named · except: Reads of viola's own executable for the pinned copy are not external input.
decision/child-output-bounded · Child output bounded and tolerant — Child process output is read under MAX_FRAME and parsed tolerantly, and a failed claude agents read fails open.
decision/hyprctl-read-deadline · hyprctl child bounded by a deadline — The hyprctl child runs with null stdin and the named environment variables removed, under a 5 s deadline at which it is killed and reaped; a deadline kill or a non-zero exit reads as unreachable. · guard: read_past_the_deadline_kills_and_reaps_its_child · provisional
decision/max-frame-cap · One external read cap — MAX_FRAME is 16 MiB, one constant in the core crate, and caps every external read. · except: viola's reads of its own executable are no external input
decision/max-frame-shared-cap · One shared MAX_FRAME cap — One 16 MiB MAX_FRAME constant bounds every external input read: channel frames, hook stdin, statusline source and output, answer input, MCP stdin lines, send text, child output, ndjson lines, config and stamps. · why: Sized above the largest expected permission input (Write-tool file bodies).
decision/test-seams-compiled-out · Test seams compiled out of release — Fake-agent test seams exist only in builds with the test-only fake-agent feature, are compiled out of every release build, configure nothing, disable no control and widen no redaction.

## data-protection · ## Data Protection
decision/hyprland-reply-text-dropped · Hyprland reply text dropped at the parse — Hyprland reply types hold no text field: window titles, classes and every other reply string are dropped at the parse and reach no log line and no error. · guard: contract_hyprland_canary_reaches_no_line_and_no_error

## dependency-security · ## Dependency Security
decision/ci-cargo-deny-gate · cargo-deny gate in CI — CI runs cargo deny check over all four check families on the root lockfile and fails the build on any advisory not on its reasoned ignore list, any yanked crate or unknown source; the fuzz lockfile is audited for advisories and sources in its own step.
decision/crates-io-only · crates.io as the only dependency source — cargo-deny denies every unknown registry and every unknown git source, so dependencies come from crates.io only. · why: keeps CVE-2026-5222's sparse-registry class out of reach
decision/exact-dependency-pins · Exact pins for third-party crates — Both lockfiles are committed, and every third-party version of the root graph and of the fuzz workspace is pinned exactly. · except: rmcp takes the minor range >=3.4.1, <3.5, and the lockfile must resolve rmcp >=3.4.1
decision/exact-third-party-pins · Exact third-party version pins — The workspace pins every third-party dependency version exactly.
decision/no-tokio-in-sync-crates · No tokio in the sync crates — tokio is banned from each sync crate's dependency graph, checked per sync crate as the sole root. · guard: deny-sync.toml; channel-tokio-free.sh; deny-probes.sh · except: viola-channel's Tokio client sits behind its tokio feature; its graph without the feature is checked to hold no tokio by the cargo tree form instead.
decision/release-build-without-test-features · Release build free of test-only features — The release build is judged from its own compiler-artifact records and refused if it holds any executable other than viola or any artifact built with a test-only feature (test-support, fake-agent). · guard: scripts/release-check.sh, its --probe run first reading 5/5 refused with a clean control
decision/cargo-deny-audit · cargo-deny as audit tool — cargo-deny 0.20.2 or newer audits advisories, bans, licences and sources.
decision/g2-single-panic-exemption · G2 zero-panics gate has one exemption — CI's G2 zero-panics gate admits exactly one exemption, a role-file panic line whose panic_location equals the FAKE_AGENT_HOOK_PANIC seam's as a whole string; any further exemption needs its own Decisions Log entry. · guard: G2 --probe run before every G2 check
decision/g2-zero-panics-single-exemption · Zero-panics gate with one exemption — CI's zero-panics gate counts every role-file panic line; any further exemption needs its own Decisions Log entry. · guard: G2 --probe · except: A panic whose location is exactly the hook seam's forced-panic file and a line number, compared as a whole string; the perf arm exempts nothing.

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · ## Bootstrap phases (derive for route / setup-project) · twin bootstrap-phases
decision/bounded-external-readers · Bounded external readers — Every external reader is wrapped by a size bound at a maximum frame size.
decision/dependency-audit-tools · cargo-deny and zizmor as audit tools — Dependency auditing uses cargo-deny >=0.20.2 and workflow auditing zizmor >=1.30.1; cargo-audit >=0.22.2 is deferred to v1.x binary scans.
decision/error-display-no-upstream-text · Error messages carry no upstream text — The Display output of the product error enums never interpolates upstream text or absolute paths.

## bootstrap-phases · ## Bootstrap phases (derive for route / setup-project) · twin bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project
decision/no-mutants-out-upload · No mutants.out upload — CI does not upload mutants.out. · why: It held absolute argv paths and test output.

## error-handling · ## Error Handling
decision/error-messages-interpolate-nothing · Error messages interpolate nothing — Product error types carry fixed Display messages with no path or payload interpolated. · guard: thiserror_messages_interpolate_nothing
decision/fixed-error-display-messages · Fixed error display messages — Every product error type's Display uses fixed messages, and variant fields holding paths or payloads are excluded from Display.
decision/sanitised-external-errors · Sanitised external error responses — Errors returned to channel clients, CLI --json and MCP drivers carry no anyhow context chains, absolute paths, upstream text, serde_path_to_error paths or values, or internal type names.
contract/channel-errors/-32600 · channel JSON-RPC errors · -32600 — A frame over MAX_FRAME gets the JSON-RPC error -32600.

## security-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## Security Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these) · twin security-anti-patterns
decision/reads-capped-at-max-frame · Reads capped at MAX_FRAME — Every channel line read, hook stdin read, child output read and MCP stdin line is capped at MAX_FRAME.
decision/no-serde-unbounded-depth · No unbounded JSON depth — serde_json's unbounded_depth feature is never enabled. · guard: deny.toml ban

## security-anti-patterns · ## Security Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these) · twin security-anti-patterns-never-do-these
decision/test-seams-fake-agent-only · Test seams only under the fake-agent feature — An environment test seam exists only under the fake-agent feature, is absent from every release build and switches off nothing; another seam or environment read needs its own Decisions Log entry.

# security-plan · its absences, names and overviews, whole

## security-plan-viola · (above the first heading)
overview/security-plan-viola — viola is a local CLI binary with a local IPC channel, a stdio MCP server and a Claude Code hook contract, with no public network surface. Its IPC, filesystem and PTY controls stand in for the auth, database and API concerns of a web stack.

## threat-model-summary · ## Threat Model Summary
absence/hosting — Hosting or containerised deployment of any kind
absence/model-api-calls — Model API calls of its own; the subscription credentials belong to the unmodified claude CLI
absence/outbound-network-calls — Outbound network calls made by viola itself
absence/public-network-listener — A public network listener or public internet API
absence/regulated-personal-data — Payment, health, children's or multi-user personal data of any kind
absence/release-and-deploy — A release, signing or deploy stage with release artefacts
absence/release-stage — A release, signing or deploy stage in v1
absence/remote-access — Remote or phone access to viola
absence/secrets — Secrets of any kind in v1
absence/third-party-personal-data — Collection of personal data from third parties
absence/websocket — WebSocket or polling endpoints

## authentication-authorization · ## Authentication & Authorization
absence/accounts-and-passwords — User accounts and passwords
absence/user-accounts-passwords — User accounts with passwords

## input-validation · ## Input Validation
absence/database — A database or query language
absence/file-upload — A file upload surface
absence/webhook — A webhook surface
overview/input-validation — Viola validates untrusted data at every point where it enters. Two validation regimes apply: tolerant parsing for external payloads and versioned-tolerant parsing for viola's own formats, with the security floors holding in both. Shared validators live in one core crate, so the CLI, the MCP server and the wrapper all call the same function.
