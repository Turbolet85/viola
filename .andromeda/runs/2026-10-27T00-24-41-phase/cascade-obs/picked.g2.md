- **Backend instrumentation hooks:** `tracing` spans around stdin parse → channel call (`hook.dialog` / `hook.event`) → decision emit, through the tracing-subscriber JSON logger. `hook-invoked` / `hook-decision` lines are required, and panics are caught with `catch_unwind` and emitted as one `level:"ERROR", event:"panic"` line (tests excerpt, Log format, Agent parsing).

- **Exporter:** A file sink only, to `diagnostics/hook-<name>.ndjson`. stderr is forbidden on both. stdout carries only the decision body for `viola hook <event>`, and for `viola hook statusline` only the user's status-line command's output (arch Standard Contracts, Hook contract); the two hidden `--capture` arms (`verify`'s probe capture) write no sink and print nothing, except `--answers`' probe decision body. A failed log write is swallowed, and the hook still exits 0 (tests excerpt, Log format Constraints).

- **Service identity:** as for the short-lived verbs, with `process="hook"`. If `VIOLA_NAME` is missing, `instance` is null and the hook is a silent no-op (tests excerpt, E1 R5 unwrapped session hooks; Coverage Triggers, Vector 4 "missing `VIOLA_NAME`"). The event and dialog paths resolve the instance directory (`canonical`) and run its strict-modes check (`trusted`: `check_instance`) before `read_diagnostics_level` and obs init: a refused or absent instance is a silent exit 0 with no `config.json` read, no role file, no stdin read, no line, no frame and no SessionEnd append. The two `--capture` arms run ahead of the check; the `FAKE_AGENT_HOOK_PANIC` seam runs after obs init.

- **OTel SDK init:** v1 initialises no OTel SDK exporter. The `tracing` facade plus the tracing-subscriber JSON formatter is the binding pipeline (tests excerpt, Log format; Founder Direction 1: "tests owns them"). The constraints ruling out an exporter:
  - no outbound network calls (security Error reporting);
  - a new listener, including a local OTLP receiver or metrics endpoint, needs a Security Decisions Log entry (security Anti-Patterns);
  - stdout is reserved on `hook`, `mcp` and `run` (arch Obs-Relevant Conventions);
  - `cargo deny` bans Tokio in the sync crates' graph and bans C-building crates (arch Observability Hints, Build policy).

  An OTel bridge layer is optional. It may only feed an in-process or file sink, and it must stay Tokio-free on the sync crates. Phase 2 evaluates whether it adds anything over the tests-fixed format.

  Init order per process:
  1. As the first statement in `main`, install a replacement panic hook that writes one JSON line and nothing to stderr. The default hook's stderr output breaks the hook contract and the `run` terminal.
  2. Parse clap.
  3. Resolve the home (`--home`, then the grandparent of `VIOLA_DIR`, then the default) and the instance (`VIOLA_NAME` or an argument). Where the role checks the home before its first open, that strict-modes check runs here — every `viola hook` arm but the two `--capture` arms (`canonical` + `trusted`); `send`, `wait`, `last`, `answer`, `pause`, `release`, `link` and `unlink` (`refuse_untrusted`); `verify` (`check_home_tree`); `run` and `viola revive`'s start (`checked_exe` + `check_home_tree`) — and a refusal ends the process with nothing under the home opened and no line.
  4. Open `diagnostics/<process file>` in append mode with 0600 permissions inside a 0700 directory.
  5. Install the subscriber with an explicit writer (never stdout).
  6. Emit `process-start`.

  For `run`, this completes before the start sequence, so the collision check and version gate are logged. For `mcp`, it completes before the rmcp stdio transport starts.

- **Logging stack:** `tracing` with tracing-subscriber 0.3.23, configured as `fmt().json().flatten_event(true).with_current_span(false)` (tests excerpt, verbatim). Version 0.3.23 satisfies the security Vector 9 floor of `>=0.3.20` (RUSTSEC-2025-0055). Sink rules:
  - one file per process role under `diagnostics/`;
  - no stdout sink on any role;
  - stderr JSON only for `mcp`, and only when `mcp.ndjson` cannot be opened (D-09).

  The writer must emit each formatted line as a single `write` on an append-mode handle (arch Crash-safe disk writes). Concurrent `hook` processes share one file.

  The level filter is not read from `RUST_LOG`. Arch says "environment variables are not a configuration channel", and security Anti-Patterns ban env, flag or config values that disable any control. Any verbosity control therefore comes from `--home/config.json` or a CLI flag and must never bypass redaction. There is no separate agent-mode flag: JSON-to-file is the only mode.

  Timestamps must be RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and `Z` (tests excerpt, `timestamp`; arch Timestamps). Phase 2 must verify whether the tracing-subscriber default timer meets millisecond precision, or whether a chrono-based `FormatTime` (`to_rfc3339_opts(SecondsFormat::Millis, true)`) is needed.

- **Format:** JSON-per-line. There are two streams:
  - **Event stream:** product events in `instances/<name>/events.ndjson`, exactly the arch Event line `{"v":1,"ts","instance","kind","source":"hook|wrapper|cli","data"}`.
  - **Process logs:** emitted by tracing-subscriber 0.3.23 `fmt().json().flatten_event(true).with_current_span(false)`, writing to `<home>/diagnostics/{run-<name>,hook-<name>,mcp,cli-<name>}.ndjson`. Files are 0600, dirs 0700, with one `write` per line.
- **Required fields:**
  - For process logs: `timestamp` (RFC 3339 UTC with ms and `Z`), `level` (`DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR`), `target`, and `fields.message` (or the flattened `message`).
  - `event`, a closed kebab-case enum. A new value needs a Decisions Log entry, like the §3 closed enums. Each value fixes what its `corr` holds:
    - `channel-request`, `channel-response`: `corr` = the JSON-RPC request `id`
    - `dialog-raised`, `dialog-answered`: `corr` = `dialog_id`
    - `hook-invoked`, `hook-decision`: `corr` = `dialog_id` for dialog hooks, otherwise null
    - `send-issued`, `send-confirmed`, `send-refused`: `corr` = the send `cursor`
    - `process-start`, `process-exit`, `panic`: `corr` = null
  - `process` (`run|hook|mcp|cli`) and `instance` (a `ViolaName` or null).
  - `corr` is copied unchanged as a JSON number or string. It is never renamed (for example to `correlation_id`).

  obs-plan may add fields but must not rename or remove these. The harness greps on them.
- **Constraints:**
  - The hook trace is the `hook-<name>.ndjson` file. A failed write there is swallowed, so the hook still exits 0 and never writes to stderr.
  - No line may contain a `Cookie` header or any stripped `CLAUDE*` value. This is enforced by the secret-scan test in §6.
- **Agent parsing:** lines parseable with `jq -c 'select(.event=="dialog-raised")'` or equivalent; NEVER multi-line stack traces. A panic in a hook is caught and logged as one `level:"ERROR", event:"panic"` line.
```

- **Log file location:** Tests require `<home>/diagnostics/{run-<name>,hook-<name>,mcp,cli-<name>}.ndjson`. That differs from two upstream statements:
  - arch Obs-Relevant Conventions (Diagnostics location): `<viola home>/instances/<ViolaName>/diagnostics/`;
  - security Vector 2 and Data Classifications: only `instances/<name>/diagnostics/` may hold user content.

  Obs aligns to tests (tests is upstream) on file basenames and on the `logs` wrapper `{"src":"diag","file":<basename>,"record":<line>}`. The directory root (home-level or instance-level) must be reconciled in Phase 3/5 with a Decisions Log entry. If `mcp.ndjson` sits at home level, it must never carry user content.

  `mcp` always writes `<home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson`, as tests assume (D-09; stderr JSON only when the file cannot be opened; landed at chunk 2026-10-17-mcp-server-for-drivers).

  Every file is 0600 inside a 0700 directory (Windows: home DACL), and the tests secret-scan test enforces it. The product holds it at open too: `open_role_file` and `write_detail` run `strict::check_diagnostics` on the existing `diagnostics/` folder and on the role or detail file before anything is created or narrowed — a symlink refused, a folder held to the read rule (Unix: no group or other bit; Windows: no read grant to another SID), a file to the read rule on Unix and the write rule on Windows — and a refusal is a failed open (no role file opened; a detail line dropped). Retention is the lifetime of the session home (tests excerpt, `logs`); there is no rotation in v1 (security Vector 7).

- **Required log fields:** `event`, `process="run"`, `instance`, `corr=null`, `cli_version`, `cli_verified`, `exit_code`. Exit-1 causes use a distinct `detail` code: already-live, squatted-name, sha-256 mismatch, `.cmd`/`.bat` child, and for a start made by `viola revive` also no-session, session-live and cwd-missing. A revive whose instance check refuses writes no line: the check precedes the log (chunk 2026-10-10-budget-governor). A `run` or a revived start whose home-tree check (`check_home_tree`, through `checked_exe`) refuses writes no line either, so that exit-1 cause has no `detail` code: the check precedes the wrapper log, and the output is the home pair (a home-level refusal) or the instance pair (an instance-level one), revive `--json` the `strict-modes-failed` document. No path or pid appears in the detail.
