## design-philosophy · ## Design Philosophy
decision/capability-ledger · Version-stamped capability ledger — Any behaviour of the `claude` CLI that viola relies on is a row in a version-stamped capability ledger; a CLI version is verified only when its stamp holds every relied ledger row `pass`, and `viola verify` re-stamps it. · why: The docs lag the installed build, and several load-bearing behaviours are measured, not documented.
decision/send-confirmed-after-the-fact · Every send confirmed after the fact — A send is confirmed only by a matching `prompt-submitted` within the compiled confirmation window (never in `config.json`), or for a ledger-listed local command by its measured post-condition; otherwise `not-delivered`; the ledger decides, never a leading slash. · why: A turn boundary per the hooks does not prove the input box is ready. · except: A ledger-listed local command whose post-condition is none, not yet measured, or whose CLI is unverified returns `ok` with `confirmed: false` and detail `unconfirmable`.
decision/no-daemon-disk-is-shared-truth · No daemon; the disk is the shared truth — Every wrapper owns its own local-socket endpoint, every other verb is a separate process owning no endpoint, and all state shared between processes lives in ndjson logs and atomic snapshots that survive a crash on either side.

## stack-and-technologies · ## Stack and Technologies
decision/atomic-replaced-state-files · Replaced files through one atomic helper — Snapshots and every other replaced file go through one shared helper that sets the mode on a temp file before the write, syncs, and persists it in one attempt. · why: crash-safe multi-process writes with no C code
decision/cargo-deny-dependency-policy · cargo-deny dependency policy — cargo-deny enforces advisories, licences, sources and bans: C crates, telemetry crates, feature bans, and tokio banned per sync crate.
decision/chrono-timestamps · chrono RFC 3339 UTC timestamps — Timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC with millisecond precision, through chrono. · why: already in the tree through rmcp
decision/mcp-server-rmcp · rmcp is the MCP server — The MCP server is an rmcp stdio server with schemars tool input schemas, rmcp minor pinned, a thin adapter over viola-channel.
decision/msrv-floor · Declared MSRV floor 1.96 — The workspace declares rust-version 1.96 and CI builds against that floor without touching the toolchain pin. · why: the security toolchain floor · guard: msrv CI job
decision/no-unbounded-json-depth · serde_json unbounded_depth banned — serde_json's unbounded_depth feature is banned. · why: every parse of external bytes keeps serde_json's default recursion limit · guard: deny.toml
decision/rmcp-release-features · rmcp release features exactly server and transport-io — The release graph's rmcp features are exactly server and transport-io. · guard: scripts/rmcp-features.sh
decision/run-never-reads-screen-content · run never reads screen content — run never reads screen content; the only row-text exit of the screen is read by verify alone, for its signature-only recorded screen fixtures.
decision/rust-toolchain-pin · Rust toolchain pinned exactly — Rust is the language of one native binary, pinned exactly by rust-toolchain.toml with rustfmt and clippy, edition 2024.
decision/versioned-records-no-migrations · Versioned records instead of migrations — Every record carries v, readers skip unknown kinds and fields, and a snapshot with an unsupported v is rebuilt by replaying the log. · except: process-log lines carry no v; their version lives in the schema filename, because obs's default-deny field list admits no v key
decision/vt100-screen-model · vt100 as screen model — vt100 gives pre-send readiness and modal detection on run's feed thread and the screen of verify's interactive probe runs.
decision/ci-ubuntu-fake-agent · CI on ubuntu against the fake agent — CI builds, lints and tests on ubuntu-latest native runners against the fake agent, with SHA-pinned actions and toolchains installed by rustup.
decision/hybrid-concurrency · Std threads everywhere, Tokio only inside mcp — Every CLI verb runs on std threads; Tokio is built only inside mcp. · why: no async runtime on the hot hook path; the async ecosystem is used only where rmcp requires it
decision/libc-only-os-binding · libc is the one OS-binding crate — libc is the one OS-binding crate of the Linux-only build, a plain dependency; no crate depends on windows-sys.
decision/preserve-key-order · Printed documents keep declared key order — serde_json's preserve_order feature is on, so a printed document keeps its declared key order.
decision/serde-serialization · serde for frames, logs and snapshots — serde and serde_json serialize channel frames, log events and snapshots, and parse external payloads tolerantly with path-precise drift reports.

## established-decisions · ## Established Decisions
decision/chrono-utc-millisecond-timestamps · chrono timestamps, RFC 3339 UTC, milliseconds — chrono writes every timestamp viola writes as RFC 3339 UTC at millisecond precision. · why: chrono is already in the tree through rmcp.
decision/claude-first-no-adapter-trait · Claude-first, one agent crate, no adapter trait — All Claude-specific logic (hook JSON parsing, dialog answer mapping, the identity strip, child program resolution, the Claude half of the CLI version gate) lives only in `viola-agent-claude`, which stays pure; the other layers speak only normalised events. · why: A trait designed before a second agent exists would encode guesses; isolating the agent in one crate keeps the later extraction mechanical.
decision/cli-capability-ledger · Per-behaviour CLI capability ledger — Every load-bearing Claude Code CLI behaviour viola relies on is a row of a closed capability ledger, probed by viola verify and stamped per CLI version; a CLI version is verified only when its stamp holds every relied row pass. · why: The docs lag the installed build, and several load-bearing behaviours are measured, not documented.
decision/cli-human-text-json-exit-codes · Human text by default, --json for agents — CLI verbs print human text by default and a machine document under --json, with a typed exit code per refusal; without --json the human output is unchanged. · why: Agents need machine-parseable refusals.
decision/cli-output-conventions · Human text by default, --json for agents — The CLI prints human text by default and `--json` for agents, with a typed exit code per refusal. · why: Agents need machine-parseable refusals.
decision/compact-confirm-window · /compact confirmation window — A /compact send waits a compiled 40 s window for its post-condition, validated per CLI version by the local-command-compact row against the measured compact latency. · provisional
decision/compact-confirmed-by-same-session · /compact confirmed by the same session — /compact on a verified CLI is confirmed by a session-start of cause compact whose agent session id equals the remembered one, and by no prompt-submitted.
decision/confirm-window-compiled · Confirmation window compiled — The confirmation window is a compiled 10 s, never in config.json, validated per CLI version by the confirm-window ledger row; run reads no window number from the stamp. · except: A /compact send waiting for its post-condition has its own 40 s window.
decision/every-send-confirmed · Every send is confirmed — A send not matched by a prompt-submitted within the confirmation window is reported not-delivered with detail no-prompt-submitted. · why: A turn boundary per the hooks does not prove the input box is ready; confirmation is the backstop behind the screen gate.
decision/exact-prompt-match · Exact prompt match after agent normalisation — The typed text is matched exactly against prompt-submitted's text, whatever its origin, after the agent crate removes the long-paste wrapper and its frame and reverses tag escaping, so the wrapper-side matcher never sees a Claude-specific shape.
decision/gate-timings-compiled · Readiness gate timings compiled — The quiet period (300 ms) and the maximum wait (8.5 s) are compiled built-ins, validated per CLI version by the stamped quiet-period ledger row. · why: The maximum wait covers the CLI's 8.0 s paste hint.
decision/mcp-server-on-rmcp · MCP server on rmcp over stdio — The MCP server viola serves to drivers is built on the rmcp SDK over stdio, pinned to one minor version. · why: rmcp is the official SDK and tracks the MCP spec; the pinned minor limits churn from its near-weekly releases.
decision/no-probe-for-unrelied-shapes · No probe for a shape no send relies on — A CLI shape that no send relies on needs no ledger probe; the paste frame beside typed text and between two pairs stays compiled and held by unit cases only. · why: Ratified ruling on the ledger rule; such shapes arise only when a human types beside a paste, so no claim and no wheel decision rests on them.
decision/no-typing-into-trust-dialogs · viola types into no trust dialog — viola types into neither the folder trust dialog nor the external CLAUDE.md imports dialog.
decision/poisoned-screen-model · Poisoned screen model reads not ready — A caught vt100 panic or a dropped feed message poisons the screen model until the host size changes, and a poisoned model reads input-not-ready. · why: A dropped byte desynchronises the screen.
decision/real-cli-probe-local-only · Real CLI probes run only locally — The real claude probe and --record run only locally; CI runs verify against the fake agent's print mode and its interactive modes.
decision/rmcp-stdio-mcp-server · rmcp stdio MCP server — rmcp, its minor pinned, is what serves MCP, over stdio. · why: The official SDK.
decision/screen-rows-read-only-by-verify · Screen row text read only by verify — The screen model has one row-text exit, and only viola verify reads it.
decision/screen-signatures-compiled · Screen signatures as compiled literals — Modal and input-box signatures are compiled literals validated by each CLI version's stamp; a screen is ready when a row holds an input-box literal and no row holds a modal literal. · why: The input-box literal (shift+tab to cycle) is mode-independent and held by no other CLI text read.
decision/send-waits-out-paste-hint · Send waits out the paste hint — On a verified CLI a send issued while the paste hint stands waits in the readiness gate for the input box, bounded at 8.5 s; a hint that outlasts the bound ends not-delivered / input-not-ready with nothing typed. · why: Ratified ruling.
decision/sync-core-tokio-only-in-mcp · Hybrid sync core, Tokio only in mcp — The core is synchronous, and Tokio is confined to the `mcp` subcommand; among the product crates only `viola-mcp` enables `tokio`. · why: portable-pty's handles are blocking, so the pump needs threads either way; `hook` must not pay for runtime startup; rmcp and interprocess-async require Tokio. · guard: sole-root `cargo deny` `tokio` ban (`deny-sync.toml`) and a `cargo check` of the sync crates on `ubuntu-latest` · except: `viola-channel`'s optional `tokio` feature, enabled by `viola-mcp`; its graph without the feature is proven tokio-free.
decision/tempfile-snapshot-writer · tempfile as the snapshot writer — Snapshots and every other replaced file are written through the shared helpers built on tempfile `persist` and `persist_noclobber`; no call site carries its own temp + rename code, a failure leaves the target as it was, and the pinned copy is never replaced. · why: atomic-write-file's BSD-3-Clause licence is outside `deny.toml`'s allow list, and tempfile was already locked.
decision/tokio-only-in-mcp-crate · tokio only in the MCP crate — Among the product crates only viola-mcp enables tokio; viola-channel lists it optional behind its tokio feature, and no other product member's normal graph reaches tokio. · guard: scripts/channel-tokio-free.sh
decision/unverified-cli-transport-only · Transport-only degrade on an unverified CLI — On a CLI version that is not verified, viola still types, runs the wheel and emits events, but withholds dialog answers, drivers get `unverified-cli`, and the readiness gate is partial. · why: The docs lag the installed build, and several load-bearing behaviours are measured, not documented.
decision/verify-box-wait-for-literal · Verify waits for an input-box literal after added turns — After each added paste turn of viola verify, the rows the paste guard reads come only from a quiet screen holding a compiled literal, a poisoned screen, or the probe deadline; a quiet screen with no literal keeps waiting. · why: Measured: after a long paste the CLI footer holds no input-box literal for about 8 s.
decision/verify-child-set · Verify's bounded child set — viola verify makes one print-mode probe, five interactive PTY runs under the R8 strip at a fixed 80×24, and one agents --json read inside Run B, pasting only compiled texts. · why: Each widening of the child set was ratified.
decision/verify-never-types-into-dialog · viola verify never answers a CLI dialog — No `viola verify` run writes a byte into a CLI dialog.
decision/verify-plan-files-in-run-dir · Plan-mode probe keeps plan files in its own dir — The plan-mode verify run points plansDirectory at a 0700 plans dir inside its own 0700 run dir. · why: So the plan file lands inside the run's own dir and none under the user's own plans directory.
decision/verify-record-only-clean · Fixtures recorded only from a clean verify — viola verify --record writes its scrubbed fixtures only when 0 rows fail, and an unclean recording is refused whole, naming the file and the check code, never the content.
decision/verify-refuses-untrusted-home-or-stamps · Verify refuses an untrusted home tree or stamps — A strict-modes refusal of the home tree, before any probe, or of the stamps, again at the write, makes viola verify exit 1 with the home pair and leaves the stamps neither read nor written. · why: Run's version gate trusts the stamps verify writes, and the verify window test expects the widened stamps byte-equal with strict-modes-failed on the line.
decision/verify-types-nothing-into-dialogs · Verify never types into a CLI dialog — No viola verify run writes a byte into a CLI dialog, and a start showing a modal is killed with no key. · why: Ratified rulings.
decision/viola-name-prefix · viola prefix for names — The product, the binary and identifiers use the `viola` prefix, environment variables included (`VIOLA_NAME`, `VIOLA_DIR`, `VIOLA_BIN`, newtype `ViolaName`). · why: One name everywhere removes the need to translate between prototype and product. · except: Ratified: test seams `FAKE_AGENT_PUMP_DELAY_MS`, `FAKE_AGENT_HOOK_PANIC` (fake-agent builds only); `NO_COLOR`, `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, read never set, deciding only SGR bytes.
decision/vt100-readiness-gate · vt100 as a pre-send readiness gate only — vt100 0.16.2 serves only as a pre-send readiness gate: after `turn-ended` it waits for a quiet screen, requires no known modal signature and waits, up to its maximum wait, for the version-stamped input-box signature; the passthrough never waits on the model. · why: CLI-native modals bypass every hook, and the screen lags the hooks.
contract/claude-cli-version-output/first-line · Claude CLI --version output · first line — Must read exactly X.Y.Z (Claude Code); output viola cannot parse counts as an unlisted version.
contract/not-delivered-details/input-not-ready · not-delivered refusal details · input-not-ready — A screen not ready at the readiness gate's bound is refused `not-delivered` with this detail, nothing typed.
contract/send-results/input-not-ready · send results · input-not-ready — A screen not quiet within the maximum wait, a poisoned model, a quiet screen still without an input-box row at the bound, or a modal on a verified CLI makes send type nothing and report not-delivered with detail input-not-ready.
contract/viola-verify-exit-codes/1-relied-row-failed · viola verify exit codes · 1 — A relied ledger row failed; the failing row's stamp is still written.
contract/viola-verify-output/step-line · viola verify stdout · step line — One line per relied row, [NN/MM] <row id> <row words>  pass|fail, MM being the relied row count.
contract/viola-verify-output/summary-line · viola verify stdout · summary line — stamped <ver>  N pass  M fail.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/unclean-fixture · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · unclean-fixture — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when a recording is unclean; the fixture's file enters no code.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/version-unreadable · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · version-unreadable — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when the CLI version cannot be read.
decision/child-exit-on-process-handle · Child exit detected on the process handle — Child exit is detected on the process handle, never on EOF.
decision/ci-against-fake-agent · CI on ubuntu-latest against the fake agent — GitHub Actions on `ubuntu-latest` runs the tests against the fake agent; the real CLI runs only in local live tests. · why: No tokens spent, no flakes in CI, and no cross-compilers (cross 0.2.5 is stale).
decision/clear-confirmed-by-new-session · /clear confirmed by a new session — /clear on a verified CLI is confirmed by a session-start of cause clear whose agent session id differs from the remembered one, and by no prompt-submitted.
decision/fake-agent-after-double-dash · Fake agent named after -- — The fake agent is substituted by naming its executable after `--` (`viola run <name> -- <fake agent> <args>`).
decision/harness-prompt-prefixes · Harness prompts classified by raw prefix — A prompt whose raw start matches a compiled harness prefix (<agent-message from=, <task-notification>, <\cross-session-message, <cross-session-message) is filed harness; an escaped tag is typed text and never classifies harness. · why: Ratified; the escaped cross-session prefix rests on a relayed measurement that the CLI's own injection arrives escaped. · except: <\cross-session-message is a harness prefix, so a human who types that tag at a prompt's start is filed harness too.
decision/local-command-post-conditions · Local commands listed with delivery post-conditions — The ledger lists each known built-in local command with its delivery post-condition or none; skills are not local commands. · why: Built-in local commands fire no UserPromptSubmit, while skills expand into a prompt and fire it.
decision/local-commands-by-ledger · Local commands classified by the ledger — A send is a local command only by exact equality of its typed text with the ledger's local-command list, never by a leading slash; any other slash text, skills included, is an ordinary send. · why: Local commands fire no UserPromptSubmit and would otherwise be false negatives; /clear matters most as drivers clear between skills.
decision/mcp-stdin-bound-in-own-reader · MCP stdin bound in viola's own reader — The MCP stdin line bound sits in the reader viola hands rmcp, never in rmcp's codec, and a cut reads as end of stream, never as an I/O error. · why: rmcp's stdio transport reads each line unbounded and its codec bounds only the writer side; end of stream keeps rmcp from writing anything of its own.
decision/mcp-stdin-line-cap · MCP stdin read under a line cap — The MCP server's stdin is read under a `MAX_FRAME` line cap, newline counted; a longer line is refused whole, never truncated or skipped, and ends the session with one `parse-rejected{parser:"mcp-stdin"}` line holding no byte of it. · why: rmcp's stdio transport reads each line unbounded, so the bound sits in the reader viola hands rmcp.
decision/mcp-stdin-oversize-refused-whole · Oversize MCP stdin line refused whole — An MCP stdin line longer than the frame cap reaches rmcp as no byte and ends the session as at a closed stdin; the line is never truncated and never skipped. · why: A truncated line could dispatch a padded valid request, and a skipped one leaves the peer unanswered with no signal; follows the wrapper channel's close-on-oversize rule.
decision/ndjson-logs-and-atomic-snapshots · ndjson append logs plus atomic JSON snapshots — State is kept in ndjson append logs and atomic JSON snapshots, with std `File::lock` on separate `.lock` files; the log stays the source of truth. · why: The trail stays human-readable and `tail`-able, with no C in the build and no daemon; SQLite and redb were rejected.
decision/partial-gate-on-unverified-cli · Partial readiness gate on an unverified CLI — On a CLI version with no passing stamp the gate still refuses a poisoned model and a screen not quiet within the maximum wait, and a quiet screen is ready with no row read, leaving the rest to delivery confirmation.
decision/permission-request-question-stays-null · A question first raised by PermissionRequest stays null — A question first raised by PermissionRequest stays null to the human. · why: A PermissionRequest allow with updatedInput would satisfy it, but that body has no ledger row; adding one needs a 25th row, its viola verify probe and a re-stamp of every stamped version.
decision/personal-v1-no-accounts · Personal v1 without accounts — v1 runs on the founder's own subscription with no accounts, and its on-disk state is parsed defensively. · why: The later public version for individual Claude Code subscribers must not need a rewrite.
decision/private-mode-before-write · File mode set before any byte is written — A replaced private file's temp file has its mode set before any byte is written, then is written, synced and persisted.
decision/prompt-normalise-order · Classify before unwrapping and un-escaping — Prompt normalisation classifies harness on the raw prefix first, then removes any long-paste wrapper with its frame, then un-escapes a backslash after < before an ASCII letter or /. · why: So a typed pair is never unwrapped and delivery matching compares plain text.
decision/send-never-types-trailing-newline · Send never types a trailing newline — send never types a text that ends in a newline. · why: A pasted text's own last newline never reaches the hook.
decision/send-text-line-endings · Send text line-ending normalisation — A `send` types its text with every CR LF pair and every other CR as one LF, and without its trailing CR and LF characters.
decision/send-time-bound · Send time bound — send blocks at most the readiness gate's maximum wait plus the paste plus the window, and on the MCP surface that total stays below the MCP client's tool-call timeout.
decision/separate-lock-files · Locks on separate .lock files — State locks are std `File::lock` on separate `.lock` files, opened for write, so no file is both appended to and exclusively locked. · why: A layout chosen while Windows, where append plus exclusive lock fails, was a target, and kept.
contract/human-hint-lines/input-not-ready · Human hint lines · input-not-ready — Reads "<name> was not ready for input; send again, and if it repeats a human must look at the session" for a modal, a never-quiet screen, a poisoned screen or a hint past the bound; no hint line is printed for the paste-hint cause.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/interrupted · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · interrupted — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when verify is interrupted.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/pinned-hash-mismatch · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · pinned-hash-mismatch — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when the pinned copy's hash does not match.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/program-not-found · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · program-not-found — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when the program is not found.
contract/viola-verify-refusal-codes/strict-modes-failed · viola verify process-exit refusal codes · strict-modes-failed — Written on the process-exit verify logs under a parsed VIOLA_NAME when a strict-modes check refuses; a refused home tree writes no line.

## conventions · ## Conventions
decision/fake-agent-test-seams · Fake-agent test seam variables — The test seams `FAKE_AGENT_PUMP_DELAY_MS` (capped at 5 s) and `FAKE_AGENT_HOOK_PANIC` (fires only on the exact value `1`) are read only under the `fake-agent` feature and are absent from release builds. · why: Neither product plumbing nor harness-only, so each carries neither prefix; a ratified exception.
decision/timestamp-format · Timestamp format — Timestamps are always RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and a `Z` suffix, as in `2026-09-23T19:43:58.123Z`.
contract/verify-process-exit/interrupted · viola verify process-exit detail · interrupted — The code verify's process-exit carries when stopped before its rows are checked; a failing row is no refusal and carries no code.
contract/verify-process-exit/unclean-fixture · viola verify process-exit detail · unclean-fixture — The code verify's process-exit carries for an unclean recorded fixture; the fixture's file enters no code.
decision/absent-optional-fields-omitted · Absent optional fields omitted on write — viola omits an absent optional field on write rather than writing `null`.
decision/first-refusal-only · Only the first refusal returned — Of several refusals only the first is returned, in a fixed order per verb, `control-character` first.
decision/harness-env-var-prefix · Test-harness knobs carry the AGENT_RUN_ prefix — Test-harness knobs use the `AGENT_RUN_` prefix and are never read by the `viola` binary; the `FAKE_AGENT_*` seams, read only by fake-agent builds, and each crate's test-private self-spawn markers (`PTY_SEAM_TEST_*`, `MCP_*_TEST_*`) keep their own names.
decision/json-field-names-snake-case · JSON field names in snake_case — JSON field names are snake_case in every viola format. · except: `last_assistant_message`, `resets_at` and `used_percentage` stay as Claude emits them.
decision/mcp-tools-list-held-to-recorded-exchange · MCP tools/list held to a recorded claude exchange — The served tools/list result is held to a recorded claude exchange's result key and type shape, its tool names in order. · guard: mcp_recorded_exchange (viola-e2e)
decision/timestamp-field-names · Timestamp field names — Every instance event, and the `hook.event` frame, carries its own instant in the field `ts`; request frames carry no instant, process-log and detail lines carry `timestamp`, and other instants use `*_at` fields, except the start instant a link record holds.
contract/cli-exit-codes/0 · CLI exit codes · 0 — ok.
contract/cli-exit-codes/1 · CLI exit codes · 1 — Internal error, and the start, revive-preflight and verify refusals, a refused home-tree check or socket directory of the start among them, each an unable and hint pair on stderr with no path, or under --json one refusal document.
contract/mcp-list-results/cachescope · MCP list results · cacheScope — The tools/list and server/discover results each carry cacheScope private, because claude drops every tool of a list result without it.
contract/mcp-list-results/ttlms · MCP list results · ttlMs — The tools/list and server/discover results each carry ttlMs 0, because claude drops every tool of a list result without it.
contract/verify-process-exit/pinned-hash-mismatch · viola verify process-exit detail · pinned-hash-mismatch — The code verify's process-exit carries when the pinned copy fails its re-hash.
contract/verify-process-exit/program-not-found · viola verify process-exit detail · program-not-found — The code verify's process-exit carries when the claude CLI is not found.
contract/verify-process-exit/strict-modes-failed · viola verify process-exit detail · strict-modes-failed — The code verify's process-exit carries on a strict-modes refusal.
contract/verify-process-exit/version-unreadable · viola verify process-exit detail · version-unreadable — The code verify's process-exit carries when the CLI version cannot be read.
contract/verify-refusals/home-tree · viola verify refusals · home tree — A refused home tree exits 1 with the home-state unable and hint pair on stderr and no step line, summary or log line; a strict-modes refusal while measuring exits 1 with the same pair after the step lines, and with an instance set its process-exit carries strict-modes-failed.
contract/verify/no-json · viola verify · --json — viola verify takes no --json.

## standard-contracts · ## Standard Contracts
decision/malformed-stamps-unverified · Malformed or untrusted stamps read unverified — A non-`v:1` or wrong-shaped stamps envelope, or a strict-modes refusal, makes run's gate record cli_verified:false with one parse-rejected line.
decision/mcp-over-stdio · MCP over stdio only — MCP speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio; the MCP server is stdio only.
decision/stamps-merge-own-version-only · Stamps merge replaces only its own version — A stamps merge replaces only its own version's entry and keeps unknown versions and unknown fields; bytes of the wrong shape are replaced whole.
decision/stamps-writer-checks-before-and-under-lock · Stamps writer checks strict modes before and under its lock — The stamps writer runs the strict-modes check of the ledger folder and the stamps file before creating the folder and again under its lock, and a refusal reads no stamps, never runs the update and writes none. · why: Verify stamps the home through it and run trusts those stamps; a path another user could write must not be read or rewritten.
decision/version-verified-all-relied-rows · A CLI version is verified only when every relied row passes — A version is verified only when every relied ledger row reads pass, so a stamp of an older, shorter row set reads unverified.
contract/event-data/prompt-submitted-text · event data per kind · prompt-submitted text — `prompt-submitted` data is `{text, origin}`; `text` is the submitted prompt as typed, the long-paste wrapper and its frame removed and tag escaping reversed.
contract/event-prompt-submitted/text · prompt-submitted event data · text — The submitted prompt as typed, with any long-paste wrapper and its frame removed and tag escaping reversed; a pasted text that ended in a newline is one byte short of it.
contract/ledger-stamps/content · ledger stamps envelope · content — Per CLI version, the envelope holds each ledger row's `pass` or `fail` and the probe's measured values, of which `run` reads none.
contract/ledger-stamps/malformed-envelope · ledger stamps envelope · malformed envelope — A malformed envelope makes `run`'s gate record `cli_verified:false`.
contract/ledger-stamps/measured · ledger stamps envelope · measured — The probe's readings (largest hook payload per spine event, typed_probe timings, dialog_probe); additions need no v bump, and run reads no field of it.
contract/ledger-stamps/rows · ledger stamps envelope · rows — Maps each ledger row id to "pass" or "fail".
contract/ledger-stamps/verified-version · ledger stamps envelope · verified version — A CLI version is verified only when every relied ledger row reads `pass`.
contract/ledger-stamps/writer · ledger stamps envelope · writer — `ledger/stamps.json` is atomically replaced JSON written only by `viola verify`; its `writer` is the literal `"verify"`, not a binary version.
decision/statusline-only-shell-out · Statusline command is the only shell-out — The user's statusline command is the only shell-out in viola: one argument of `/bin/sh -c`, with the same stdin, environment and working directory unchanged, stderr discarded, bounded by a deadline. · why: The command is a user-written shell string; a ratified boundary widening. · guard: ledger row statusline-shell
contract/snapshot-envelope/shape · snapshot envelope · shape — A snapshot is atomically replaced JSON of the shape `{v, written_at, writer, data}`.

## occupied-resources · ## Occupied Resources
decision/no-live-claude-in-ci · No live claude in CI — When CI is present, the test harness's run --local-live refuses before any build, spawn or suite, and viola itself never reads the harness variables. · why: so the real claude never runs in CI
decision/recorded-fixtures-scrubbed · Recorded fixtures scrubbed and hygiene-walked — Fixtures recorded by viola verify --record are written only when no row fails, each is scrubbed and hygiene-walked, and an unclean recording is refused whole, naming the file and the check code, never the content. · guard: contract_fixture_hygiene
decision/screen-fixtures-signature-rows-only · Screen fixtures keep only signature rows — A recorded screen fixture keeps only the rows that hold a compiled signature literal; every other row is an empty string.
decision/stamps-single-writer · Ledger stamps have one writer — ledger/stamps.json has one writer, called only by viola verify, which checks strict modes before and under the lock and replaces the file whole; a refusal reads and writes nothing.
decision/strict-read-rule · Strict-modes read rule — The strict-modes read rule is the write rule plus a refusal of any group or other permission bit.
decision/test-seams-not-configuration · Test seams are not a configuration channel — Test-seam environment variables are read only by a viola built with the test-only fake-agent feature, never by a release build, and a seam disables no control and widens no redaction.
decision/verify-probe-dirs-drop-guarded · verify probe dirs removed by drop guard — Every probe dir viola verify creates is private and removed whole when verify passes, fails or is stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM, only the dirs that run created, never by a pattern or a listing. · why: its captures are transient, content-bearing raw hook payloads
decision/verify-removes-only-own-dirs · verify removes only the probe folders it created — viola verify removes its probe folders whole when it passes, fails or is stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM, and only the folders that run created, never by a pattern or a listing. · except: SIGKILL, a crash or a failed handler install leave the folders to be removed by hand.
decision/verify-run-e-resumes-run-b-first-session · Verify's Run E resumes Run B's first session — Verify's Run E resumes the session id taken from Run B's first SessionStart, only when that id has a session id's shape; with no such id Run E starts no child, so Run E depends on Run B running before it. · why: The resume ledger row checks Run E's first SessionStart for source resume and that same id, and the five runs execute in order A to E.
decision/verify-sole-stamps-writer · verify is the one stamps writer — viola verify is the one writer of the ledger stamps; run's version gate reads them behind the strict-modes check, and a refusal records cli_verified false.
decision/version-gate-strict-stamps-read · Version gate reads stamps strictly — run's version gate reads the stamps only after the owner-only strict-modes check; a refusal records cli_verified false and one parse-rejected ledger-stamps strict-modes-failed line.
contract/verify-exit-detail/interrupted · viola verify process-exit detail · interrupted — The detail of a stopped run; a failing ledger row is no refusal and carries no code.
contract/verify-exit-detail/pinned-hash-mismatch · viola verify process-exit detail · pinned-hash-mismatch — A refusal code verify writes under a parsed VIOLA_NAME.
contract/verify-exit-detail/program-not-found · viola verify process-exit detail · program-not-found — A refusal code verify writes under a parsed VIOLA_NAME.
contract/verify-exit-detail/strict-modes-failed · viola verify process-exit detail · strict-modes-failed — A refusal code verify writes under a parsed VIOLA_NAME; a refused home tree writes no line.
contract/verify-exit-detail/unclean-fixture · viola verify process-exit detail · unclean-fixture — A refusal code verify writes under a parsed VIOLA_NAME; the fixture's file name enters no code.
contract/verify-exit-detail/version-unreadable · viola verify process-exit detail · version-unreadable — A refusal code verify writes under a parsed VIOLA_NAME.
contract/viola-mcp-exit-codes/0 · viola mcp exit codes · 0 — The session ended by stdin closing, or by a stdin line past MAX_FRAME, once initialized; both streams empty.
contract/viola-mcp-exit-codes/1 · viola mcp exit codes · 1 — The session ended before initialize, or the home or diagnostics folder failed the strict-modes check, with nothing on stdout or stderr and no role file.
contract/viola-verify-exit-codes/1 · viola verify exit codes · 1 — The home-tree check refused the home, ledger, bin or plugin folder, before any log or step line, or the stamps update was refused; the home-state unable/hint pair is printed.
decision/codes-only-role-logs · Codes-only role logs — Home-level role logs hold codes only, with no row text, prompt, id, path or endpoint; content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's owner-only detail files.
decision/fake-agent-pump-delay-seam · FAKE_AGENT_PUMP_DELAY_MS test seam — FAKE_AGENT_PUMP_DELAY_MS is read only by a viola built with the test-only fake-agent feature, parsed as milliseconds capped at 5 000, and holds the pump back after the child starts; it disables no control and widens no redaction. · why: Ratified as a security-plan Security Anti-Patterns carve-out: a test seam, not a configuration channel.
decision/path-under-a-file-is-a-strict-modes-refusal · A path under a regular file is a strict-modes refusal — A trusted path whose stat fails for any reason other than absence, as under a regular file, is refused as unreadable: verify exits 1 with the home's pair and the frame verbs exit 21 with the instance's pair. · why: Only an absent path may be skipped by the check; verify's regular-file test pins the exit code and the pair.
decision/strict-check-before-log-open · Strict-modes check before any log opens — Every checked entry point runs its strict-modes or instance check before any log opens or any file under the home is read. · why: Opening a log sets an existing home to 0700, so a check made after it would pass a home at 0770.
decision/viola-env-namespace-product-only · VIOLA_ environment namespace is product plumbing — Test-only environment markers stay outside the VIOLA_* namespace, which is reserved for product plumbing.
contract/diagnostics-role-files/mcp · home-level diagnostics role files · mcp.ndjson — viola mcp's codes-only lines, ending with a self process-exit (exit_code 0, no detail) once stdin closes.
contract/viola-cli-arguments/verify · viola CLI arguments · verify — viola verify takes [--record <DIR>] [-- <program> [args…]], the program defaulting to claude.

## cross-cutting-patterns · ## Cross-cutting Patterns
decision/capability-ledger-gate · Capability ledger as the single gate for CLI behaviour — Any new dependence on an undocumented claude behaviour is added as a capability-ledger row in viola-agent-claude with a viola verify probe that has a post-condition check, never hard-coded as an unconditional assumption. · why: A ruled limit sets the exception. · except: A CLI shape no send relies on needs no probe, such as the long-paste frame beside typed text and between two pairs.
decision/crash-safe-disk-writes · Crash-safe disk writes — Append-only logs use one write per line, mutable files are replaced atomically, every guarded file has its own .lock sibling, and readers always tolerate a torn last line.
decision/serde-json-unbounded-depth-banned · serde_json unbounded depth banned — The serde_json unbounded-depth feature is banned in the dependency policy. · guard: serde_json_unbounded_depth_is_banned_in_deny_toml
decision/unconfirmed-delivery-not-delivered · Unconfirmed delivery reported as not-delivered — Any failure to confirm delivery is reported as not-delivered and never retried blindly. · except: A ledger local command whose post-condition is none or not yet measured on this CLI version is reported as ok with confirmed false and detail unconfirmable.
contract/mcp-output/stdout · MCP server output · stdout and stderr — viola mcp writes only MCP frames to stdout; when its role file cannot be opened it exits 1 and prints nothing.
decision/bounded-readers · Bounded readers at every boundary — Every product reader of external bytes is bounded in its own statement or named as an exception; none reads an external byte source to its end unbounded. · guard: contract_bounded_readers: product_readers_are_each_bounded_or_named · except: The own-executable reads, which are no external input.
decision/ci-linux-fake-agent · CI on Linux against the fake agent — CI runs on GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest against the fake agent.
decision/mixed-version-tolerance · Mixed-version tolerance — Every channel params, event, snapshot and config carries v; readers of own formats skip unknown kinds and fields and surface the counts.
decision/no-environment-configuration · Environment variables are no configuration channel — No environment variable configures viola; the VIOLA_* variables are wrapper-to-child plumbing set by viola run only, and a dependency or feature that reads an environment variable breaks the rule like a direct read does. · except: NO_COLOR, TERM and COLORTERM for list's human-mode colour; XDG_RUNTIME_DIR for the socket dir; PATH for program lookup; two fake-agent test seams compiled only under the fake-agent feature.
decision/tokio-containment · Tokio containment — Code on the run, hook, send and channel-server paths uses std threads and blocking I/O; only viola-mcp may build a Tokio runtime, and CLI wait is a blocking read on the channel's sync client.

## project-intent · ## Project Intent
decision/wrap-unmodified-claude · Wrap the unmodified claude CLI — viola drives the unmodified claude CLI wrapped in a PTY, typing at turn boundaries and answering dialogs through hooks, with a one-driver wheel the human can take at any moment.
decision/modular-monolith-no-daemon · Modular monolith, no daemon — The product is one binary with compiler-enforced internal crates (pty, channel, state, agent-claude, mcp around core) and no daemon.

## inherited-defaults · ## Inherited Defaults
decision/claude-shapes-isolated · Claude-specific shapes isolated — Claude-specific shapes live only in viola-agent-claude.
decision/one-shared-persist-helper · Snapshots persisted through one shared helper — Atomic JSON snapshots are written with tempfile persist through one shared helper.
decision/rmcp-for-mcp · rmcp serves MCP — rmcp is what serves MCP.
decision/rust-toolchain-pinned · Pinned Rust toolchain — The Rust toolchain is pinned by rust-toolchain.toml, with a declared MSRV and edition 2024.
decision/ndjson-logs-and-json-snapshots · State in ndjson logs and JSON snapshots — State is kept in ndjson append logs and atomic JSON snapshots guarded by std file locks, with serde_json.
decision/tolerant-serde-external · Tolerant serde for external payloads — External payloads are deserialised tolerantly.
contract/timestamps/format · Timestamps · format — Timestamps are RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z, in fields named ts or ending in _at, produced with chrono.

## build-system · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/banned-features · Banned dependency features — The features veil/toggle, rmcp auth and transport-streamable-http-server, and tracing-subscriber/env-filter are banned. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/crates-io-only · Sources from crates.io only — Every dependency comes from crates.io only. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/deny-bans-proven · Every dependency ban proven live — Every dependency ban is proven live: a throwaway project per ban must fail with that ban's own diagnostic, and a clean control must pass. · guard: scripts/deny-probes.sh
decision/deny-single-target · Dependency policy for one target triple — The dependency policy is evaluated for the one target triple x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.
decision/licence-allowlist · Licence allowlist — Dependency licences allowed are exactly MIT, Apache-2.0, Zlib and Unicode-3.0. · why: The 0BSD exception was ratified. · guard: cargo deny check · except: 0BSD only through the per-crate exception for doctest-file, never through the allowlist.
decision/msrv · Minimum supported Rust version 1.96 — The workspace declares rust-version 1.96, and dependency resolution prefers versions compatible with it.
decision/no-c-building-crates · No C-building crates — C-building crates (cc, libsqlite3-sys, openssl-sys) are banned from the dependency graph. · guard: cargo deny check · except: The fuzz workspace's libfuzzer-sys builds C++ via cc, a ratified test-only exemption: never linked into viola, and fuzz never joins the root workspace.
decision/no-telemetry-crates · No telemetry crates — Telemetry crates (opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry, tracing-appender) are banned. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/rmcp-features-exact · rmcp with exactly server and transport-io — rmcp is present in viola's release graph with default features off, and the features requested of it are exactly server and transport-io. · guard: scripts/rmcp-features.sh
decision/sync-crates-tokio-free · Sync crates are tokio-free — Tokio is banned anywhere, direct or transitive, in the normal dependency graph of viola-core, viola-pty, viola-state and viola-agent-claude, checked once per crate as the sole root. · why: A direct-parent allowlist would let Tokio arrive through a third-party feature; excluding over the workspace false-fails under feature unification. · guard: deny-sync.toml per crate in scripts/sync-crates.txt
decision/workspace-dependency-pins · Third-party versions pinned in one place — Every third-party dependency version is pinned once in the workspace dependency table and shared by the members that take it.
decision/fuzz-lockfile-audited · Fuzz lockfile audited separately — The fuzz workspace's own lockfile is audited separately for advisories and sources. · guard: CI supply-chain step Fuzz lockfile audit; nightly advisories job
decision/serde-json-recursion-limit · serde_json keeps its recursion limit — The serde_json unbounded_depth feature is banned. · why: Every parse of external bytes keeps serde_json's default recursion limit. · guard: probe row serde_json-unbounded-depth
decision/single-human-writer · One human writer in the root bin — The root bin writes human output only through its human module, whose writers lock the stream and swallow a closed pipe instead of panicking; hook and obs never call it.
contract/human-stderr/refusal · Human stderr · refusal — A refusal writes the two fixed `unable:` / `hint:` lines as one write.

## ci-cd-approach · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/github-actions-ci · GitHub Actions CI — CI runs on GitHub Actions: one push and pull-request pipeline on ubuntu, and a weekly scheduled workflow.
decision/msrv-ci · MSRV checked in CI — A CI job checks the workspace and runs the unit tests on Rust 1.96. · guard: gate --require nextest-unit
decision/real-claude-local-only · Real claude CLI only locally — The real claude CLI runs only locally, never in CI; in CI viola verify runs only against the fake agent, and its real-CLI probe and record run only locally. · guard: tests/cli_verify.rs
decision/sync-crates-compile-without-tokio · Sync crates compile without tokio — Each listed sync crate, the hook path included, is checked to compile on its own with no tokio; an empty list or an absent package fails.
decision/weekly-advisories · Weekly advisory audit — A weekly job audits advisories over both the root and the fuzz lockfile. · why: The advisory database moves without code changes.
decision/tests-against-fake-agent · Tests run against the fake agent — The workspace test suite runs against the fake agent, replaying recorded Claude fixtures.

## crate-dependency-direction · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/agent-claude-pure · viola-agent-claude does no file I/O — viola-agent-claude takes no viola-state dependency and writes no file; stamps, budget and settings files are written by viola-state and the root bin. · why: So the crate stays pure.
decision/claude-shapes-in-one-crate · Claude payload shapes in one crate — viola-agent-claude is the only crate that knows Claude payload shapes, including those of claude agents --json.
decision/mcp-dependencies · viola-mcp takes channel with tokio — viola-mcp depends on viola-channel with its tokio feature and on tokio, and takes no serde.

## project-directory-structure · key of ## Infrastructure Patterns
decision/cargo-deny-bans · cargo-deny supply-chain policy — cargo-deny checks advisories, licences and sources, and bans C dependencies, telemetry and listed features. · guard: deny-probes negative probe per ban with a clean control
decision/exact-toolchain-pin · Exact Rust toolchain pin — The project builds on one exactly pinned stable Rust toolchain with rustfmt and clippy, never a floating channel. · except: The separate fuzz workspace uses its own pinned nightly toolchain.
decision/no-tokio-in-sync-crates · No tokio in sync crates — Every crate on the single sync-crate list must have no tokio in its graph, each checked as the sole root. · guard: cargo-deny tokio ban over the sync-crate list
decision/rmcp-exact-features · rmcp features exactly server and transport-io — viola's release graph requests rmcp with exactly the features server and transport-io. · guard: rmcp-features check in the CI lint job

overview/project-intent — viola is a hybrid local developer tool that lets one interactive Claude Code session drive another on the user's own subscription. It has a native Linux CLI binary and a Claude Code plugin of hooks and a stdio MCP server that calls that binary; a keyboard-driven terminal fleet console is planned, not built. It wraps the unmodified claude CLI in a PTY, types at turn boundaries, answers dialogs through hooks, and holds a one-driver wheel the human can take at any moment. It is a modular monolith: one binary with internal crates around core, and no daemon.
