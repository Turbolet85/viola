# obs-plan · the rows that bind 2026-11-13-verify-readiness-on-the-input-box — picked 318 of 1059 (131 by every draw) · rule any · pin 803

## obs-plan-viola · (above the first heading)
decision/agent-readable-telemetry · Agent-readable telemetry only — Every telemetry signal must be readable by an agent from a snapshot or pasted log excerpt: no human-only dashboards, no proprietary APM lock-in, no human-review-gated log analysis. · except: A surface that cannot be agent-readable is flagged not-instrumentable and handled through boundary instrumentation only.

## 1-obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin obs-scope-summary
decision/claude-internals-not-a-contract · Wrapped claude internals are not a contract — The wrapped claude CLI is a third-party binary run unmodified and instrumented at its boundary only (spawn and exit, paste writes, the vt100 readiness-gate outcome); its internal state and transcripts are never read as a contract.
decision/distinct-detail-code-per-exit-cause · Distinct detail code per exit cause — Each cause behind exit 21 and exit 1 gets a distinct detail code with no path or pid. · except: A strict-modes check refused before any log opens writes no line; its cause is the fixed stderr pair or the --json document.
decision/drift-reports-diagnostics-only · Drift reports go to diagnostics only — Drift reports of viola-agent-claude go to diagnostics/ only and nowhere else. · why: The outputs of viola-agent-claude are the most sensitive in the product.
decision/mcp-stdio-server-tokio-allowed · MCP server on stdio with Tokio allowed — The `viola mcp` surface is an internal stdio MCP server, and Tokio is allowed in it.
decision/mcp-stdout-frames-only · MCP stdout carries frames only — No telemetry from the viola-mcp server may go to stdout. · why: Stdout is reserved for MCP frames.
decision/obs-deps-tokio-free · Obs dependencies Tokio-free and C-free — Obs dependencies stay Tokio-free in the sync crates, add no C-building crates and pass cargo deny. · guard: cargo deny
decision/parse-failures-unknown-counter · Parse failures surface as unknown plus a counter — A child-output parse failure surfaces as `unknown` plus a counter.
decision/pty-byte-stream-never-logged · PTY byte stream never logged — The PTY byte stream is never logged; the viola-pty seam is instrumentable, and the openpty OS API behind it is boundary-only. · why: The PTY byte stream is user content.
decision/rmcp-stdio-mcp-server · rmcp stdio MCP server — The viola-mcp crate is an rmcp stdio MCP server.
decision/state-sync-instrumentation · Sync instrumentation in viola-state — Instrumentation in viola-state must be sync. · why: The Stack bans Tokio in viola-state.
decision/stderr-fixed-strings · Fixed strings on stderr — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/strict-modes-failure-lines · Where a strict-modes failure is logged — A strict-modes failure has a log line only on the `ledger-stamps` read in the `run` version gate and on `verify`'s own `process-exit` for a refused stamp write.
decision/stripped-claude-env-never-logged · R8-stripped CLAUDE values never logged — R8-stripped CLAUDE* environment values are never logged anywhere. · why: The viola-agent-claude outputs are the most sensitive in the product.
decision/typed-keys-never-logged · Typed keys never logged — Keys a human types never appear in a log line; the wheel product event in events.ndjson is the audit record.
contract/diagnostics-files/mcp · the diagnostics files · mcp — Role mcp writes its role file mcp.ndjson in the home's diagnostics folder, which never carries user content; a role file that cannot be opened ends the server with exit 1 and nothing on stderr.
contract/process-exit-detail/strict-modes-failed · process-exit detail codes · strict-modes-failed — Carried by `verify`'s `process-exit` for a refused stamp write, with exit 1.
decision/agents-probe-parse-failure-unknown · Agents probe parse failure becomes unknown — A parse failure of the claude agents --json probe becomes status "unknown" plus a parse-rejected counter; an unparsed --version answer leaves cli_version absent and the version unverified.
decision/child-exit-from-process-handle · Child exit from the process handle — The wrapped child's exit and its process-exit event come from the wait on the process handle, never from reader EOF.
decision/claude-fixtures-scrub-required · Claude fixtures are scrub-required — Build and CI infrastructure is not instrumented, and the claude fixtures are scrub-required data, never a telemetry source. · why: Not product runtime.
decision/cli-file-sink-only · Short-lived CLI logs to a file sink only — Short-lived CLI verbs log only to a JSON-per-line file sink in diagnostics when an instance resolves, never to stdout. · why: Stdout carries the --json results.
decision/diag-schema-additive-only · Diagnostic log schema is additive only — The log format JSON schema is binding: observability may add fields or extend the event enum through a Decisions Log entry, and must not rename or remove any field.
decision/diagnostics-owner-only-modes · Diagnostics files are owner-only — Every diagnostics file is mode 0600 inside a 0700 directory.
decision/error-chain-fixed-stderr-message · Error chains reach stderr as fixed messages — In the viola root binary, the only crate that uses anyhow, an error chain that contains a serde source becomes a fixed message before it reaches stderr, and the full chain goes to the diagnostics logs only.
decision/mcp-log-file-sink · MCP logs to a file sink, never stdout — The `mcp` process always logs to the file sink `<home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson`, with no stderr fallback: a file that cannot be opened exits 1 printing nothing, and the log writer is set explicitly. · why: stdout is forbidden because it carries MCP frames
decision/stripped-env-never-logged · Stripped CLAUDE env values never logged — No R8-stripped `CLAUDE*` value appears in any sink or fixture; the strip is logged as a count or variable names only.
decision/tracing-json-line-file-pipeline · tracing JSON-per-line file pipeline — Telemetry is tracing plus tracing-subscriber writing JSON-per-line files under diagnostics/, correlated by corr and consumed through agent-run logs and status. · why: The pipeline is the one the tests plan binds.
decision/tracing-json-pipeline · tracing with the tracing-subscriber JSON formatter — The `tracing` facade plus the tracing-subscriber JSON formatter is the binding logging pipeline, and JSON-to-file is the only logging mode.
contract/diag-line/instance · diagnostic log line · instance — The instance's `ViolaName`; the key is absent when the process has no instance.
contract/diag-line/process · diagnostic log line · process — The role of the writing process, one of run, hook, mcp, cli; required on every line and matching `sender` / `writer`.
contract/diag-line/service-name · diagnostic log line · service.name — Hardcoded to "viola".
contract/diag-line/service-version · diagnostic log line · service.version — The crate version, fixed at compile time.
contract/diagnostics-files/cli · the diagnostics files · cli — Role cli writes <home>/diagnostics/cli-<name>.ndjson, only when an instance resolves.
contract/log-line/process · every log line · process — Every log line carries a process key naming its role: one of run, hook, mcp, cli.
contract/mcp-stdin/max-frame · viola mcp stdin · MAX_FRAME — Stdin is read in lines of at most `MAX_FRAME`; a longer line is refused whole and the session ends as at a closed stdin.

## obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin 1-obs-scope-summary
decision/claude-boundary-only-instrumentation · Boundary-only instrumentation of claude — The hosted claude binary is instrumented only at its boundary: spawn and exit, paste writes, and the vt100 readiness-gate outcome. · why: claude is a third-party binary run unmodified.
decision/detail-codes-no-paths · Detail codes carry no path or pid — No path or pid appears in a detail code.
decision/exit-code-log-field · Exit code as a log field — The exit code (0, 1, 2, 10–14, 20, 21), the machine-readable outcome, is carried as a log field.
decision/fixed-stderr-messages · Fixed stderr refusal and fault lines — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/no-process-log-without-instance · No process log without an instance — A short-lived CLI verb run with no resolved instance writes no process-log file; its human stderr carries only fixed-message lines, and its outcome is the exit code and stdout.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen · No telemetry from screen content — No telemetry is derived from screen content; vt100 serves gate outcomes only.
decision/obs-deps-no-c-building-crates · Obs dependencies build no C — Observability dependencies add no C-building crates.
decision/obs-deps-pass-cargo-deny · Obs dependencies pass cargo deny — Observability dependencies pass cargo deny on its one target, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu. · guard: cargo deny
decision/per-parser-parse-failure-counts · Per-parser parse-failure counts — Each parser that drops input (channel framing at MAX_FRAME, the viola mcp stdin at MAX_FRAME, hook stdin, claude agents --json, vt100 under catch_unwind) keeps its own parse-failure count; paste validation refuses a send as not-delivered instead.
decision/strict-modes-refusal-writes-no-line · Strict-modes refusal writes no line — A strict-modes check refused before any log opens ends the process with nothing under the home opened and no log line; its cause is carried only by the fixed stderr pair or the --json document. · why: Ratified as the answer to whether a refused strict-modes check logs. · except: The ledger-stamps read in run's version gate and a refused update_stamps in viola verify each leave a line.
decision/sync-instrumentation-no-tokio · Sync instrumentation without Tokio — Instrumentation in the sync crates runs on std threads with no Tokio. · why: Hybrid concurrency. · guard: cargo deny ban
contract/process-log-corr/panic · Process log corr by event · panic — corr is null.
contract/process-log/child-and-probe-lifecycle · Process log · child and probe lifecycle — process-start and process-exit are logged for the claude child and for the claude agents --json and --version probes.
contract/process-log/event · Process log line · event — A closed kebab-case enum; a new value needs a Decisions Log entry, and each value fixes what its corr holds.
contract/viola-verify/home-tree-refused · viola verify · refused home-tree check — A refused home-tree check exits 1 with the home pair, opens no log and writes no line; a refused update_stamps exits 1 with the home pair and, when an instance is named, ends the opened log with a process-exit line carrying detail strict-modes-failed.
decision/child-exit-from-handle-wait · Child exit from the process handle — The child's process-exit comes from the wait on its process handle, never from reader end-of-file. · why: Child exit is detected on the process handle.
decision/claude-exit-on-process-handle · Claude exit detected on the process handle — The exit of the hosted claude process is detected on the process handle, never on EOF.
decision/diagnostics-file-modes · Diagnostics file and directory modes — Diagnostics files are 0600 inside 0700 directories. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/diagnostics-owner-only-permissions · Diagnostics owner-only permissions — Files under diagnostics/ are 0600 inside 0700 directories. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/fixtures-not-telemetry · Recorded fixtures are no telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are scrub-required data, not a telemetry source, and are excluded from the observability plan. · why: Not product runtime.
decision/home-level-mcp-log-no-user-content · Home-level MCP log holds no user content — An mcp.ndjson at home level never carries user content.
decision/ipc-crate-sync-instrumentation · Synchronous instrumentation in the IPC crate — Instrumentation in the interprocess IPC crate must be synchronous. · why: Stack forbids Tokio in the crate's graph unless its feature is enabled.
decision/log-fields-additive-only · Required log fields only added to — Fields may be added to process-log lines, but the required ones are never renamed or removed. · why: The harness greps on them.
decision/mcp-log-sink · MCP log sink — viola mcp always logs to <home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson once the home and its diagnostics/ pass strict-modes; a file that cannot be opened exits 1 printing nothing, with no stderr fallback.
decision/mcp-no-telemetry-on-stdout · No telemetry on the MCP server's stdout — The MCP server sends no telemetry to stdout. · why: stdout is reserved for MCP frames.
decision/messaging-secrets-never-logged · Messaging secrets never logged — CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN, CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET and every R8-stripped CLAUDE* value are never logged in any sink, detail files and fixtures included. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/no-secrets-in-log-lines · No secrets in log lines — No log line may contain a Cookie header or any stripped CLAUDE* value. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/panic-hook-replaced · Panic hook replaced by a one-line writer — Each process replaces the default panic hook, as the first statement in main and before any child spawns, with one that writes one JSON line and nothing to stderr. · why: The default hook prints to stderr, which breaks the hook contract and is the child's terminal under run.
decision/parse-failures-surface-as-unknown · Parse failures surface as unknown — A parse failure surfaces as the value unknown plus a counter.
decision/process-logs-file-sink-only · Process logs to a file sink only — Process logs are written only as JSON lines to one file per process role under diagnostics/; there is no network exporter and no stdout sink. · why: viola makes no outbound network calls, and stdout carries --json results.
decision/r8-strip-logged-as-names-only · R8 strip logged as names only — The R8 environment strip is logged as a count and lists of stripped and kept variable names, values never read, and environment maps never pass to a span or event.
decision/serde-chain-fixed-message · Serde error chains become a fixed message on stderr — An error chain that contains a serde source becomes a fixed message before it reaches stderr.
decision/serde-errors-become-fixed-message · Serde errors become a fixed message — An error chain holding a serde source is replaced by a fixed message before it reaches stderr.
decision/single-line-log-records · Single-line log records — Every log record is one JSON line parseable by jq; never a multi-line stack trace.
decision/state-crate-sync-instrumentation · Synchronous instrumentation in the state crate — Instrumentation in the state crate built on ndjson, atomic-write-file and sysinfo must be synchronous. · why: Stack bans Tokio in that crate.
decision/stripped-claude-values-never-logged · Stripped CLAUDE values never logged — R8-stripped CLAUDE* values are never logged anywhere. · why: Its outputs are the most sensitive in the product.
decision/structured-json-process-logs · Structured JSON process logs — Every process role (run, hook, mcp, cli) writes structured JSON process logs under diagnostics/, which harness logs merges with events.ndjson.
decision/subscriber-explicit-writer · Subscriber installed with an explicit writer — The tracing subscriber is always installed with an explicit writer, never stdout. · why: tracing-subscriber fmt() writes to stdout unless a writer is configured, and stdout carries MCP frames.
decision/tracing-json-logging-pipeline · tracing with a JSON subscriber for logging — Logging and spans go through the Rust tracing facade with a tracing-subscriber JSON structured logger.
decision/tracing-subscriber-logger · tracing-subscriber is the logger — The logger dependency is tracing-subscriber at version 0.3.20 or later.
decision/tracing-subscriber-version-floor · tracing-subscriber version floor — tracing-subscriber is held at version 0.3.20 or later. · why: The security floor for RUSTSEC-2025-0055.
contract/dialog-log-line/unverified-cli · Dialog log line · unverified-cli — The detail unverified-cli goes with exit 12.
contract/exit-21-detail/strict-modes-failed · Exit 21 detail codes · strict-modes-failed — strict-modes-failed is a distinct detail code for an exit-21 cause, naming no path or pid.
contract/process-log-corr/process-exit · Process log corr by event · process-exit — corr is null.
contract/process-log-corr/process-start · Process log corr by event · process-start — corr is null.
contract/process-log/corr · Process log line · corr — Copied unchanged as a JSON number or string, never renamed.

contract/process-log/level · Process log line · level — One of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.
contract/process-log/message · Process log line · message — A required field, as fields.message or the flattened message.
contract/process-log/process · Process log line · process — The process role, one of run, hook, mcp, cli.
contract/process-log/target · Process log line · target — A required field.
contract/process-log/timestamp · Process log line · timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z.

## 2-telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin telemetry-strategy
decision/one-line-panic-record · One structured line per panic — Every panic after init step 4 produces exactly one single-line structured record in its home-level role file with location, thread, role and instance; payload and backtrace go only to the instance-scoped detail file. · except: the bounded panic exemptions listed in the plan's Section 10
decision/metrics-derived-by-jq · Metrics derived by jq, no instruments — Metrics have no in-process instruments and no exporter; they are derived by jq over the ndjson logs.
decision/no-external-error-reporter · No external error reporter — Errors have no external reporter. · why: Security says no outbound network calls.
decision/no-proprietary-apm-sdk · No proprietary APM SDK — No proprietary APM SDK is used, as primary or at all; the v1 exporter role is filled by the local file sink.

## telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin 2-telemetry-strategy
decision/panic-caught-at-every-role · Panics caught at every role's catch site — A hand-written panic hook plus catch_unwind at every role's main-thread catch site (covering hook dispatch and run's inline handle-wait), the two run PTY pump threads and the vt100 feed turn a panic into one record.
decision/panic-one-line-record · One single-line record a panic — Every panic after obs init produces exactly one single-line structured record in its home-level role file, with location, thread, role and instance; payload and backtrace go only to the instance-scoped detail file. · except: the pre-init window and the paths that refuse or lack an instance or home tree before their role file opens
decision/pre-open-strict-modes-refusal-silent · Strict-modes refusal before a log opens writes no line — A strict-modes refusal made before any process log opens writes no line and carries no logged detail code; its machine-readable form is the exit code and, under --json, its closed document. · except: a refused socket directory always logs detail socket-dir-refused, except at MCP's frame tool, which writes no line
contract/strict-modes-refusal-exit/1 · strict-modes refusal exit codes · 1 — run, revive's start and verify exit 1 on a strict-modes refusal; revive under --json prints the strict-modes-failed document.
decision/metrics-derived-from-ndjson · Metrics derived from logs, no instruments — There are no in-process metric instruments and no exporter; metrics are derived by jq over the ndjson logs, and perf gates run on hyperfine JSON exports.

## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/codes-only-process-logs · Codes-only process logs, content in detail files — Every role's codes-only process log goes to its home-level role file under diagnostics, and content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's per-role detail file.
contract/mcp-output/stdout · mcp output streams · stdout — mcp writes only MCP frames to stdout.
decision/short-lived-verbs-stderr · Short-lived verbs use stderr for humans — Short-lived CLI verbs may use stderr for their human output.

## 4-span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin span-trace-coverage
decision/child-settings-never-logged · Child settings argument never logged — The claude child's --settings argument appears in no log line or span.
decision/ci-verify-fake-agent-only · CI verify against the fake agent only — In CI, viola verify runs only against the fake agent.
decision/dependency-targets-off-in-sink · rmcp and portable-pty targets off — The rmcp and portable-pty log targets are switched OFF in the sink.
decision/detail-codes-only · detail is a closed code — The detail field is a closed kebab-case code catalog and never carries a path or pid.
decision/env-names-only · Environment names only, never values — The strip and every log record environment variable names only, never values, and no env map is passed to a span or event. · guard: E2
decision/ledger-contents-never-logged · Capability ledger path and stamps never logged — The capability ledger's path and its stamp contents never appear in a log line.
decision/no-assistant-message-in-logs · No assistant message or result body in logs — last_assistant_message never appears in a log, and no result body reaches a log line.
decision/sent-text-never-logged · Sent text never logged — A sent message's text is never logged; only its size in text_bytes is.
decision/unreadable-ledger-is-unverified · Unreadable ledger counts as unverified — A missing stamp, or an unreadable, malformed or strict-modes-refused capability ledger, counts as unverified (cli_verified false).
decision/verify-lines-redacted · verify lines carry no content — No verify or plugin install line carries row text, a prompt, a session id or a path.
decision/verify-logs-only-with-instance · verify and plugin install log only inside an instance — With VIOLA_NAME set, verify and plugin install log process-start / process-exit to cli-<name>.ndjson; from a plain terminal with no instance they write no process-log file.
contract/claude-child-process-start/env-kept · process-start line of the claude child · env_kept — Reports the variables kept after the R8 environment strip on process-start{subject:"claude-child"} by names only, never values.
contract/claude-child-process-start/env-stripped-count · process-start line of the claude child · env_stripped_count — Reports the R8 environment strip on process-start{subject:"claude-child"}; never an environment value.
contract/claude-child-process-start/env-stripped-known · process-start line of the claude child · env_stripped_known — Reports the R8 environment strip on process-start{subject:"claude-child"} by variable names only, never values.
contract/viola-verify-refusal/home-tree-refused · viola verify strict-modes refusal · home tree refused — Before logging, verify holds the home, ledger/, bin/ and plugin/ to the strict-modes check; a refused tree exits 1 with the home pair and writes no line.
contract/viola-verify-refusal/stamp-write-refused · viola verify strict-modes refusal · stamp write refused — A ledger/stamps.json the stamp write refuses prints the home pair and exits 1 through verify's own process-exit line.
decision/capture-arms-uninstrumented · Hidden capture arms uninstrumented — The two hidden capture arms of verify / plugin install are uninstrumented by design.
decision/dialog-content-never-logged · Dialog content never logged — Dialog questions, answers, plan text and tool input never appear in a home-level process-log line; dialog events carry codes only, and the text reaches an instance detail file only inside a chain or drift report.

## span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin 4-span-trace-coverage
decision/cli-log-only-under-viola-name · cli process log only under a parsed name — A short-lived cli verb opens its process log and writes process-start and process-exit only when an instance resolves: for list, plugin install and revive --list under a parsed VIOLA_NAME (with no name no log), for the frame verbs under the named target (link and unlink the driven) instance.
decision/error-chain-in-detail-log-only · Full error chain only in the cli detail log — The full anyhow error chain of a cli verb goes to the cli detail log only.
decision/no-obs-gate-on-verify-lines · No obs gate depends on verify lines — No observability gate depends on verify's own log lines; its home-level lines fall under the same panic, schema and secret-scan gates as any other.
decision/no-statusline-settings-in-telemetry · No settings or statusline command in telemetry — The child's --settings argument, the statusline source path and the statusline command appear in no log line or span.
decision/no-text-in-telemetry · Sent text never in telemetry — The sent text never appears in a span or log line; only its length does.
decision/no-typed-keys-in-telemetry · Typed keys never in telemetry — The keys the human types never appear in a span.
decision/portable-pty-log-target-off · portable-pty log target OFF — The log target of portable-pty is OFF in the sink, and PTY failures are captured at the pty seam instead.
decision/real-cli-verify-never-in-ci · Real-CLI verify never runs in CI — In CI verify runs only against the fake agent; the real-CLI verify runs only through the local live run, which refuses under CI.
decision/refused-home-tree-writes-no-line · Refused home tree writes no line — verify and plugin install check the home tree before their log opens, and a refused tree opens no log and writes no line.
decision/rmcp-tracing-target-off · rmcp tracing target OFF — The native tracing target of rmcp is OFF in the sink. · why: Its records lack required fields and can carry frame content.
decision/unreadable-ledger-means-unverified · Unreadable capability ledger means an unverified CLI — A capability ledger that is missing a stamp, unreadable, malformed or refused by the strict-modes check is treated as an unverified CLI (cli_verified false).
decision/verify-lines-carry-no-content · verify log lines carry no content — No verify log line carries row text, a prompt, a session id, the probe command, a status line payload or a path.
decision/verify-sole-stamps-writer · verify is the only stamps writer — verify is the only writer of the capability ledger's stamps file.
contract/claude-child-process-log/handle-wait-exit · run process log, claude-child lines · process-start and process-exit of claude-child — process-start is logged once the child is spawned and process-exit once the pump returns; process-exit{subject:"claude-child"} carries child_exit_status and exit_source handle-wait or kill-fallback, and is never emitted on reader EOF.
contract/claude-child-process-start/env-fields · process-start claude-child · env fields — env_stripped_count, env_stripped_known (every stripped name, comma-joined) and env_kept (every kept persistent-set name, comma-joined).
contract/cli-stderr/refusal-pair · CLI stderr · unable and hint pair — A refusal is printed to stderr as a fixed "unable:" line followed by a "hint:" line.
contract/send-span-attributes/text-bytes · confirmed send span attributes · text_bytes — text_bytes, on pty.paste_write and send-issued alike, is the typed text's length: the sent text with each CR LF pair and each other CR as one LF, trailing CR and LF removed; pty.paste_write also carries paste_mode="bracketed".
contract/verify-exit-codes/0 · verify exit codes · 0 — Every relied ledger row passed.
contract/verify-exit-codes/1 · verify exit codes · 1 — A row failed, verify refused, or verify was stopped.
contract/verify-process-exit/interrupted · verify process-exit line · detail interrupted — A verify stopped by SIGINT or SIGTERM starts no further spawn, closes every pair it opened and ends with process-exit subject self, exit_code 1, detail "interrupted".
contract/verify-process-exit/strict-modes-failed · verify process-exit line · detail strict-modes-failed — A stamps store refused by its strict-modes check, under a parsed VIOLA_NAME, ends with process-exit carrying detail "strict-modes-failed" and the home pair on stderr.
contract/verify-spawn-subject/verify-pty-probe · verify child spawn subjects · verify-pty-probe — Each of verify's five interactive PTY runs is logged as one process-start / process-exit pair with subject verify-pty-probe.

contract/verify-stdout/step-line · verify stdout · step line — One "[NN/MM] <row id> <row words>  pass|fail" line is printed for each relied ledger row, MM being the relied row count.
contract/verify-stdout/summary-line · verify stdout · summary line — The last stdout line is "stamped <version>  N pass  N fail", the two counts summing to MM.
contract/verify-stop-stderr/unable-hint-pair · verify stderr on a stop · the stop pair — A stopped verify prints exactly "unable: verify was stopped before it finished" and "hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI" on stderr, with empty stdout and no stamp written.
decision/refused-check-writes-no-line · A refused check opens no process log — A cli verb whose strict-modes, tree or instance check refuses (exit 21) opens no process log and writes no line.
contract/diag-line-schema/pty-backend · diag-line v1 schema · pty_backend — pty_backend is any string.
contract/run-log-parse-rejected/ledger-stamps · the run process log parse-rejected line · parser ledger-stamps — An unreadable, malformed or strict-modes-refused capability ledger gives one parse-rejected line with parser "ledger-stamps", detail "unreadable", "malformed" or "strict-modes-failed", and a count, in the run log.
contract/verify-spawn-subject/agents-probe · verify child spawn subjects · agents-probe — Run B's single agents --json read is logged as one process-start / process-exit pair with subject agents-probe.
contract/verify-spawn-subject/verify-probe · verify child spawn subjects · verify-probe — The print-mode probe is logged as one process-start / process-exit pair with subject verify-probe.

## metric-coverage · ## 5. Metric Coverage · twin 5-metric-coverage
decision/panic-lines-stay-zero · Panic lines stay at zero — Gate G2 counts the panic lines of the home-level role files and fails on any; no viola.panic metric is derived.

## 6-log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin log-coverage
decision/content-detail-in-instance-file · Content-bearing detail in the instance detail file — Content-bearing detail goes only to the per-process detail file inside the instance's diagnostics directory.
decision/third-party-crate-logs-off · Third-party crate logs off — The per-module log filter turns logging OFF for the rmcp, portable_pty, sysinfo and interprocess targets. · why: Their failures are captured at the viola seam as viola events.
contract/child-spawn-log/subject · child and shell spawn log events · subject — process-start and process-exit lines for child and shell spawns carry a subject from a closed set.
contract/pty-seam-log/paste · PTY seam log events · paste — A paste is logged with text_bytes only.
contract/pty-seam-log/spawn · PTY seam log events · spawn — A spawn gives process-start{subject:"claude-child"}.
decision/additive-field-naming · Additive log field naming — Additive log fields are snake_case with kebab-case values, and carry codes only.
decision/file-only-per-role-log-sinks · File-only log sinks per role — Diagnostics are written to files only, one sink per role, under the home's diagnostics directory.
decision/log-schema-additive-only · Log schema additive to the tests' format — The observability log schema only adds fields and enum values to the tests' log format; it renames and removes nothing. · why: The tests' log format is the binding text.
decision/no-event-type-field · No event_type field — Log lines carry no event_type field. · why: event already does that job, and a duplicate would amount to a rename.
decision/viola-crates-log-at-info · Viola crates log at INFO — The per-module log filter sets the viola, viola_core, viola_pty, viola_channel, viola_state, viola_agent_claude and viola_mcp targets to INFO, or DEBUG via diagnostics_level.
contract/log-levels/error · log levels · error — Used for a panic, a process-exit that carries a detail, and a channel-response with error_code -32603.
contract/log-levels/info · log levels · info — INFO carries all other boundary, lifecycle and state-transition events, including refusals, which are normal product outcomes.
contract/log-levels/warn · log levels · warn — WARN carries state-recovered; parse-rejected; hook-decision with a fail-open detail; process-exit with exit 21; channel-response with -32600 or -32602.
contract/log-line/corr · every log line · corr — Set per the tests' table and copied unchanged as a JSON number or string; null is represented by the key's absence.
contract/log-line/event · every log line · event — A value of the closed kebab-case event enum.
contract/log-line/instance · every log line · instance — The ViolaName; the key is absent when there is none.
contract/log-line/level · every log line · level — One of DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR; TRACE is never emitted.
contract/log-line/message · every log line · message — Flattened, a static literal equal to the event name.
contract/log-line/target · every log line · target — The Rust module path, for example viola_channel::server.
contract/log-line/timestamp · every log line · timestamp — RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and Z.
contract/process-start-line/service-name · process-start line · service_name — A constant service name, emitted once on process-start rather than on every line.

## log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin 6-log-coverage
contract/diag-detail/strict-modes-failed · diagnostic detail words · strict-modes-failed — Written on the process-exit exit 1 of viola verify under a parsed VIOLA_NAME and on parse-rejected ledger-stamps from the version gate of run, at warn, with no path; every other refused strict-modes check writes no log line, its exit code or JSON document its only record.
contract/diag-line-fields/panic · diagnostic line additive fields · panic — panic_location (workspace-relative, or <crate>-<ver>/src/... for dependencies) and thread; payload and backtrace go to the detail file only.
contract/diag-line-fields/parse-rejected · diagnostic line additive fields · parse-rejected — parser (claude-agents-json, vt100-feed, config-json, ledger-stamps, hook-stdin, channel-frame, mcp-stdin, state-entry), detail, count.

contract/parse-rejected-detail/panicked · parse-rejected detail · panicked — vt100-feed under catch_unwind.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/strict-modes-failed · parse-rejected detail · strict-modes-failed — ledger-stamps: run's version gate refused the stamps file on the strict-modes check, and the read counts as unverified.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/unreadable · parse-rejected detail · unreadable — config-json, ledger-stamps.
contract/process-exit-detail/interrupted · process-exit detail · interrupted — A viola verify stopped by SIGINT or SIGTERM before its rows are checked ends with one process-exit exit 1 detail interrupted, after every spawn pair it opened is closed.
contract/process-exit-detail/verify-refusal · process-exit detail · viola verify refusal — Under a parsed VIOLA_NAME, verify writes its refusal code: program-not-found, pinned-hash-mismatch, version-unreadable, strict-modes-failed, unclean-fixture or interrupted; a failing row carries no code.
contract/verify-process-exit/child-exit-status-and-duration · viola verify spawn process-exit lines · child_exit_status and duration_ms — Each of the eight verify spawn pairs' process-exit carries child_exit_status and duration_ms, including a child of an interactive PTY run killed at a Ctrl-C or TERM stop; a stopped run writes only the pairs it started.
contract/diag-detail/pinned-hash-mismatch · diagnostic detail words · pinned-hash-mismatch — A filesystem refusal word written on process-exit with exit 1.
contract/diag-subject/agents-probe · diag-line subject enum · agents-probe — Subject of the process-start and process-exit pair of the claude agents read, written by viola list, viola revive's session-live reading, verify's Run B and the list tool of viola mcp into their role files.
contract/diag-subject/self · diag-line subject enum · self — One value of the closed subject enum of the diag-line schema.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/malformed · parse-rejected detail · malformed — Any parser.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/oversize · parse-rejected detail · oversize — channel-frame beyond MAX_FRAME, hook-stdin, mcp-stdin past MAX_FRAME, vt100-feed when the bounded queue drops a copy (one line per poisoning episode), claude-agents-json past MAX_FRAME.
contract/process-exit-detail/exit-1 · process-exit detail · exit 1 — already-live, stale-heartbeat, squatted-name, pinned-hash-mismatch, internal-error, socket-dir-refused, and from revive's preflight no-session, session-live, cwd-missing; each one process-exit line with no child started.

## 7-error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin error-capture-reporting
decision/sentry-not-admissible · Sentry not admissible — sentry and sentry-tracing are not admissible. · why: They break the egress ban, and their default reqwest, native-tls and tokio transport breaks the cargo-deny C-crate and Tokio-in-sync-crates bans.
decision/vt100-panics-contained · vt100 panics contained — vt100 panics are caught around each feed and resize on run's feed thread; each poisoning episode gives exactly one parse-rejected{parser:"vt100-feed"} at WARN, and run continues.
decision/boundary-errors-end-in-logged-line · Crate-seam errors end in a logged line — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam ends in a logged process-exit detail, channel-response error, hook-decision detail or send-refused line, carrying codes only at WARN or ERROR.
decision/human-panic-rejected · human-panic rejected — human-panic is not used. · why: It writes a human report to stderr.
decision/no-sentry-or-otel-bridge · No Sentry or OTel bridge — Errors have no Sentry or OTel bridge; they correlate by corr, conn, process and instance, not by trace_id or span_id. · why: Both were deferred or rejected.
decision/tracing-panic-rejected · tracing-panic rejected — tracing-panic is not used. · why: The crate is stale.
decision/typed-errors-fixed-display · Typed errors with fixed Display messages — Every typed error has a fixed-message Display, written with thiserror, and holds no fields with paths or payloads. · except: PtyError's Display is hand-written, as viola-pty takes no thiserror.

## error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin 7-error-capture-reporting
decision/vt100-feed-panic-contained · vt100 feed panic contained — A panic in a vt100 feed or resize is caught on the feed thread, poisons the screen model until the host size changes, writes one parse-rejected per episode, and run continues.
contract/mcp-stdin/oversize-line · viola mcp stdin · line past MAX_FRAME — A line past MAX_FRAME is refused whole, gives no isError result and ends the session as a closed stdin: exit 0 after initialize, exit 1 before it with both streams empty; its one record is parse-rejected mcp-stdin oversize, no byte of the line.

decision/conversation-text-only-in-detail-file · Conversation text only in the instance detail file — Prompt, assistant, tool-input, plan and dialog text never reach a home-level line, only an instance's per-process detail file inside a chain or drift report.
decision/home-level-lines-path-free · Home-level lines path-free — Home-level log lines are path-free: file fields are basenames, panic_location is workspace-relative and source file recording is off; absolute paths appear only in detail files. · why: The OS username inside absolute paths is the only PII in scope.
decision/local-run-outputs-never-uploaded · Local run outputs never uploaded — mutants.out, the run archive and the local viola-harness pre-push document are never uploaded.
decision/default-deny-log-fields · Default-deny for logged fields — A field is logged only if it is named in the obs plan's event catalog; an unknown field is a build failure. · guard: gate G4 against schemas/diag-line.v1.json
decision/detail-upload-synthetic-inputs-only · Detail-file upload only with synthetic inputs — Detail files and the harness capture are uploaded only while every input is synthetic; a non-synthetic source first drops them from the upload paths. · why: every input is synthetic, so detail content carries no real data
decision/endpoint-and-pinned-bin-never-logged · endpoint and pinned_bin never logged — The endpoint and pinned_bin values are never logged.
decision/fixed-error-messages · Fixed error messages — Error Display texts are fixed, and serde-sourced error chains are mapped to fixed messages at dispatch.
decision/low-class-metadata-as-typed-fields · Low-class metadata as typed fields — Low-class metadata is logged as typed fields, never inside detail codes.
decision/no-regex-scrubbers · No regex scrubbers — Sensitive data is never scrubbed by regular expressions. · why: viola's sensitive data is known by type
decision/schema-top-level-unevaluated-properties · Default-deny schema via top-level unevaluatedProperties — The diagnostics line schema enforces default-deny with a top-level unevaluatedProperties false over per-event field lists. · why: in JSON Schema 2020-12 additionalProperties does not see properties declared inside allOf or if-then · guard: contract_diag_schema
decision/secrets-never-logged · Secrets never logged — The Cookie header, signing credentials and R8-stripped CLAUDE* values are never logged.
decision/source-allow-list-logging · Source allow-list for logged fields — Spans skip all arguments and declare fields explicitly, and events go through obs_event! with explicit typed fields only; this source allow-list is the primary PII control. · guard: disallowed-macros; raw_event_hits; G1 bare instrument
contract/detail-line/chain · the detail-file line · chain — One of exactly four content fields a detail-file line may carry: the full error chain.
contract/detail-line/drift-report · the detail-file line · drift_report — One of exactly four content fields a detail-file line may carry: the drift report.
contract/detail-line/event · the detail-file line · event — Required on every detail-file line, as on home-level lines.

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/detail-upload-needs-synthetic-input · Detail upload needs synthetic input — Detail files and harness captures are uploaded only while every input is synthetic; a non-synthetic input source must first drop detail files and the harness capture from the upload paths.
decision/prompt-and-output-never-in-home-logs · Prompt and assistant output never in home logs — Prompt text and assistant output, last_assistant_message included, never appear in a home-level process-log line; they reach an instance detail file only inside a chain or drift report, and only text_bytes is logged.
decision/closed-protocol-codes · Closed protocol codes — Protocol codes and refusal details are logged as closed kebab-case enums naming no param or value. · guard: answer_invalid_params_names_its_cause_and_no_param
decision/content-sink-behind-strict-check · Content sink behind a strict-modes check — The diagnostics content sink opens only after a strict-modes check of the folder and file; a symlink or a folder or file another user may read refuses the open as a failed open and the detail line is dropped. · why: High-class content is never written through a symlink or into a folder another user may read.
decision/error-bodies-clean · Clean error bodies — Error bodies of CLI --json, MCP results and the channel faults hold no absolute path, upstream caused-by text or serde path, and every product error writer is named. · guard: error_bodies_each_name_a_writer_and_a_witness_that_stand
decision/error-messages-interpolate-nothing · Error messages interpolate nothing — thiserror messages interpolate no value. · guard: thiserror_messages_interpolate_nothing
decision/fixtures-not-a-telemetry-source · Fixtures not a telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are not a telemetry source, and observability adds no fixture content.
decision/typed-ids-never-in-detail · Ids logged as typed fields — pid, child_pid, agent_session_id, started_at, budget percentages and resets_at are logged as typed fields, never inside detail codes.
decision/veil-redaction · veil derives redaction — veil 0.3.0's derived Redact is what redacts the payload fields of contract types, and instrumented spans skip all arguments.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/g1-bare-instrument-gate · G1 bare-instrument gate fails closed — Every #[instrument] must have skip_all as its first argument; the G1 gate passes only on rg exit 1 (no match), so a violation, a regex or I/O error or a missing rg fails the CI step. · guard: G1
decision/g2-zero-panics-gate · Zero-panics gate fails closed — The zero-panics gate probes itself first, fails closed, runs in the test and perf jobs, and counts panics over home-level role files only. · guard: G2 · except: the fake-agent seam's forced panic at exactly its seam location, compared as a whole string

## ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin 9-ci-integration
decision/banned-telemetry-dependencies · Banned telemetry and logging dependencies — opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry, tracing-appender, the tracing-subscriber env-filter feature and the veil toggle feature are not taken as dependencies. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/sync-crates-without-tokio · Sync crates build without Tokio — The synchronous crates must compile without Tokio. · guard: cargo check of the sync crates without Tokio
decision/zero-panics-gate · Zero panics gate — No panic line may appear in the home-level role files of test runs; detail files repeat the panic line and are excluded. · why: ratified · guard: gate G2 (scripts/g2-zero-panics.sh, --probe first) · except: a panic whose panic_location is exactly src/cmd/hook/seam.rs:<digits>, the fake-agent seam's forced panic, compared as a whole string
decision/instrument-requires-skip-all · Instrument attribute must skip all arguments — Every #[instrument] in the workspace takes skip_all as its first argument; a bare #[instrument] fails the build. · guard: gate G1
decision/no-raw-tracing-macros · No raw tracing macros outside the obs module — Raw tracing info, warn, error, debug and trace macros and raw event! are refused outside viola_core::obs. · guard: clippy -D warnings disallowed-macros; raw-event! grep and ban probes in scripts/lint-probes.sh

decision/cargo-deny-failure-fails · cargo deny failure is a failure — A cargo deny failure (Tokio, a C crate, veil toggle, banned obs crates) counts as an SLO invariant failure. · guard: cargo deny
decision/deterministic-emission · Deterministic event emission — Events key on hook events and events.ndjson offsets; nothing is derived from screen content. · except: The readiness gate reads the vt100 screen before a paste, and its verdict can refuse a send as input-not-ready.
decision/zero-unlogged-panics · Zero unlogged panics — Every panic in run, hook, mcp and cli after init step 4 produces exactly one single-line ERROR panic record in its home-level role file, with no multi-line backtrace there, and hook still exits 0; retry-once policies for panic handling are forbidden. · guard: G2 · except: the bounded exemptions where no file exists, so no line can be written; G2 alone leaves out the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic from its count.
decision/build-fails-on-any-panic · Build fails on any panic line — The build fails on any panic event line in the kept homes' role files, bar the fake-agent seam's forced panic; no gate infers a panic from an exit code.
decision/diagnostics-files-mode-0600 · Diagnostics files are 0600 — A diagnostics file whose mode is not 0600 counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/error-budget-zero-tolerance · Zero-tolerance error budget — The error budget tolerates zero panic lines in any CI artifact, zero secret-scan hits and zero schema-conformance failures. · except: the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic, as the zero-panics gate counts it
decision/module-boundary-error-logging · Errors logged once at module boundaries — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam is logged once at WARN or ERROR with a closed detail or error_code; the full chain goes only to the instance detail file.
decision/no-retry-policies · Retry policies forbidden — Retry-once policies are forbidden, for tests and for panics alike. · why: retry policies mask real signals
decision/no-sleep-based-log-waits · No sleep-based log waits — No log-based wait relies on sleeps.
decision/print-and-macro-lint-failure-fails · Print and macro lint failure is a failure — A clippy disallowed-macros, print_stdout, print_stderr or dbg_macro failure counts as an SLO invariant failure.

decision/no-retry-on-panic · No retry on panic — Retry-once policies for panic handling are forbidden. · why: Parallel to the tests' retries = 0.
decision/panic-count-home-level-only · Panic count reads home-level files only — The exactly-one panic rule and gate G2 count home-level role files only; the companion panic line in a detail file is excluded. · guard: gate G2 · except: G2 alone leaves out the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic, whose line is still written exactly once.

## 11-obs-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. Obs Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these) · twin obs-anti-patterns
decision/default-panic-hook-never-runs · Default panic hook never runs — The default panic hook is never called or allowed to run. · why: Its stderr output breaks hook and the run terminal.
decision/no-hot-path-instrumentation · No hot-path instrumentation — The PTY pump read loop and the vt100 feed get no per-byte or per-chunk span or event; only gate outcomes are logged.
decision/no-info-in-hot-loops · No info logging in hot loops — Nothing is logged at info inside hot loops such as the PTY pump; counts go on the boundary event instead.
decision/no-paths-or-pids-in-detail-codes · No paths or pids in detail codes — detail codes never contain paths or pids.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen-content · No telemetry from screen content — Telemetry is never derived from screen content; vt100 is used for readiness and modal gate outcomes only.
decision/one-line-panics · Panics are one line — Multi-line stack traces are never written; panics are logged as one line.
decision/paths-only-in-instance-detail-files · Paths only in instance detail files — Paths appear only in instance detail files.
decision/sensitive-content-detail-file-only · Sensitive content only in the instance detail file — statusline_command, send text, tool input and last_assistant_message never reach a home-level file; they may reach only the instance-scoped detail-<process>.ndjson, inside a chain or drift report.
contract/stdout-by-role/mcp · stdout by role · mcp — stdout carries MCP frames.
decision/backtraces-in-instance-detail-only · Backtraces in the instance detail file only — Backtraces are written as one-line JSON arrays in the instance detail file only.
decision/claude-env-and-cookie-never-logged · CLAUDE* values and Cookie never logged — CLAUDE* values and a Cookie header are never logged, at any level, in any file, detail files included.
decision/closed-event-and-corr-on-every-line · Closed event enum on every line, corr where correlated — Every log line carries the closed event enum, and corr rides only on the correlated events the schema allows it on, so the signal pyramid never collapses into free text.
decision/corr-set-explicitly-by-caller · corr set explicitly by the caller — The caller sets corr explicitly as a typed field on the events that carry one.
decision/event-values-closed · event values closed — No event value is added without a Decisions Log entry.
decision/field-allow-list-default-deny · Field allow-list is default-deny — No field is logged unless named in the field catalog.
decision/must-trace-paths-always-traced · Must-trace paths always traced — Spans and events are never skipped on the 6 must-trace paths. · why: The agent loses its ability to debug without them.
decision/no-bare-instrument · No bare #[instrument] — Instrumentation always uses #[instrument(skip_all, fields(...))], never a bare #[instrument]. · why: A bare #[instrument] records every argument with Debug and leaks send text, hook.dialog payloads and tool input.
decision/no-error-reporter-in-v1 · No error reporter in v1 — sentry or any other reporter is never added in v1. · why: Egress is banned, and sentry's default native-tls / tokio transport breaks cargo-deny.
decision/no-instrument-err-ret-on-sensitive · No instrument err or ret on sensitive results — #[instrument(err)] and #[instrument(ret)] are never used where the error or return can carry a serde or serde_path_to_error source or user content.
decision/no-log-bridge · No log bridge — tracing_log::LogTracer or any log bridge is never installed by hand, and tracing-log stays off. · why: Bridged records lack event, corr, process and instance.
decision/no-non-blocking-appender · No non_blocking appender — tracing-appender non_blocking is never used. · why: It drops lines when full, needs a WorkerGuard flush, and breaks the hook's exit-0 / max < 1.0 s gate and the zero-unlogged-panics invariant.
decision/no-otel-stdout-exporter · OTel stdout exporter inadmissible — The OTel stdout exporter is inadmissible on every role. · why: stdout is reserved.
decision/no-otel-without-decisions-log · No OTel without a Decisions Log entry — No OTel SDK, OTLP exporter or opentelemetry-stdout is added without a Decisions Log entry. · why: opentelemetry-otlp's default reqwest-blocking-client spins up a Tokio runtime.
decision/no-serde-source-in-error-output · No serde source in printed errors — An anyhow chain that still contains a serde_json or serde_path_to_error source is never printed to stderr, --json, MCP isError or channel error.data.
decision/no-telemetry-on-stdout · No telemetry on stdout — Telemetry is never written to stdout on any role. · why: stdout carries each role's own output and run's terminal carries the child's screen.
decision/obs-event-macro-only · obs_event! is the only event macro — tracing's event and level macros are never called directly outside viola_core::obs; events go through obs_event!. · why: Only obs_event! guarantees event, process and instance. · guard: clippy disallowed-macros; the raw-event! grep in lint-probes
decision/scrub-before-bytes-leave-process · Scrubbing before any byte leaves the process — Every byte is scrubbed of secrets before it leaves the process; in v1 the only destination is local files. · guard: the secret-scan test
decision/upload-only-after-secret-scan · Diagnostics uploaded only after the secret scan — diagnostics artifacts are never uploaded before the secret-scan step passes; uploads run if: always() / failure() combined with the secret-scan step's success, never bare.
decision/veil-toggle-banned · veil toggle feature banned — veil's toggle feature (VEIL_DISABLE_REDACTION / veil::disable()) is never enabled. · guard: cargo-deny
contract/stdout-by-role/cli · stdout by role · cli — stdout carries the --json results.

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/content-only-in-instance-detail-file · Content only in instance-scoped detail files — Content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's detail-<process>.ndjson file; home-level log files are codes-only and carry no user content, token, cookie or CLAUDE* value. · why: security allows user-derived content only in instance-scoped diagnostics
decision/no-opentelemetry-in-v1 · No OpenTelemetry in v1 — No opentelemetry crate is added in v1, and cargo deny bans opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry and tracing-appender on the workspace. · why: so they cannot arrive transitively without a Decisions Log entry · guard: cargo deny bans
decision/diag-schema-matches-event-enum · Diagnostic line schema matches the event enum — A hand-maintained JSON Schema of the process-log line is committed, and its event enum must equal the ObsEvent variants, asserted by a tests-owned check.
decision/fixed-error-display · Fixed error Display text — Typed errors have fixed Display text that carries no interpolated content.
decision/instrument-skip-all-everywhere · Spans skip all arguments — Every instrumented function uses skip_all with explicit fields, so no argument is recorded implicitly. · guard: G1
decision/obs-event-single-macro · One obs_event macro for every line — Every log line is emitted through the one obs_event macro defined in viola-core, which expands to tracing's event at the caller, so viola-core stays I/O-free and tracing-free.
decision/raw-tracing-ban · Raw tracing macros banned — The tracing level macros are banned by clippy disallowed-macros and raw event calls by a fail-closed grep outside the obs module, so only obs_event emits lines. · why: clippy reports a disallowed macro expanded inside an exported macro at the caller, so no allow inside obs_event can exempt it · guard: clippy disallowed-macros and scripts/lint-probes.sh
decision/veil-redact-payload-types · veil redacts payload types — Payload types derive veil's Redact, and cargo deny bans veil's toggle feature. · guard: cargo deny veil toggle ban

## log-file-location · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/tracing-appender-rejected · tracing-appender rejected — tracing-appender is not used as a log writer. · why: its non_blocking writer drops lines, and it pulls in an advisory-affected time crate
contract/diagnostics-files/paths · diagnostics files · process log paths — Process logs are written to <home>/diagnostics/ as run-<name>, hook-<name>, mcp and cli-<name> .ndjson files, and detail to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson.

## log-format-json-schema · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract

## logging-stack · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/third-party-targets-off · Third-party log targets off — Records of third-party targets (rmcp, portable_pty, sysinfo, interprocess) are off in every sink; their failures are captured at viola's seam from the returned results. · why: Their records lack the required fields.
decision/content-records-bypass-subscriber · Content-bearing records bypass the subscriber — Content-bearing records never pass through the tracing subscriber, whose one writer holds only the home-level role file; the detail writer formats each detail line itself and writes it with one whole write.
decision/file-only-diagnostics-sinks · File-only diagnostics, one file per role — Every role logs only to its own file under the home's diagnostics directory; no role has a stdout sink, and there is no pretty or dev sink.
decision/no-content-in-home-level-lines · No content fields in home-level lines — No home-level diagnostics line carries chain, drift_report, panic_payload or backtrace. · guard: G4 diag-line.v1.json schema
decision/no-internal-error-fallback · No stderr fallback for subscriber internal errors — The diagnostics subscriber never reports its own internal errors by printing to stderr. · why: The default falls back to eprintln, which would break the Hook contract and the run terminal rule.
decision/no-log-crate-bridge · No log-crate bridge — The log-crate bridge (tracing-log, LogTracer) stays off; failures are captured from returned values or handles, and a gap is fixed at the seam or by the researched json-subscriber fallback, never by enabling the bridge. · why: The accepted loss is only third-party log context emitted without a returned error. · guard: pty_exit_is_read_on_the_handle_while_the_output_is_held
decision/tracing-logging-library · tracing as the logging library — tracing is the logging facade and tracing-subscriber's JSON formatter writes the lines. · why: Tokio-free and no C, and meets the security floor for tracing-subscriber
contract/detail-line/fields · the detail line · fields — Each detail line carries timestamp (millisecond UTC format), level, target, message, event, process and instance, then its content fields, and no corr or conn key.
contract/diagnostics-files/detail · the diagnostics files · detail — Content-bearing records (full error chains, drift reports, panic payload and backtrace) go only to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson, file 0600 in a 0700 directory, and only when an instance resolves.
contract/diagnostics-line/detail-line-size · the diagnostics line · detail-file line size — A line in an instance detail file (chains, drift reports, one-line backtraces) is not codes-only and may exceed 4 KiB.
contract/diagnostics-line/role-file-line-size · the diagnostics line · role-file line size — A line in a role file (run, hook, mcp, cli) is codes-only and stays well under 4 KiB.

## otel-sdk-init · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/home-tree-check-before-log-init · Home tree check before log init — run, revive's start arm and viola verify check the home tree's modes before their log opens; a refusal writes no line, starts no child, leaves modes as found and exits 1.
decision/diagnostics-init-before-role-work · Diagnostics init before the role's work — Diagnostics init and the process-start line come before the role's work: in run before its collision check and the child spawn, in mcp before its stdio transport starts. · why: Exit-1 causes are logged.
decision/flat-log-lines-and-one-level-gate · Log lines are flat and Targets is the only level gate — The subscriber flattens event fields to the top level of each line, and the Targets filter is the only configurable level gate; its level comes from the home's diagnostics level and never from the environment. · why: The diagnostics schema and the log readers read event fields as top-level keys, and only the viola crates' targets pass the gate.
decision/instance-source-per-role · Instance source fixed per role — run takes its own name argument, never an inherited VIOLA_NAME; hook and mcp take VIOLA_NAME only; cli verbs that act on an instance (send, wait, last, answer, pause, release, link, unlink) take the target argument; list, verify, plugin install and revive --list take the caller's VIOLA_NAME only. · why: A wrapper never writes into another instance's run log.
decision/lazy-detail-file · Detail file opened lazily — The instance detail file is opened only by the first content-bearing record or by the panic hook, and a failed detail open drops only the detail line, writing nothing to stderr. · why: The error-free hook path keeps exactly one log open.
decision/no-otel-sdk-v1 · No OpenTelemetry SDK in v1 — No OpenTelemetry SDK, bridge or Resource is used in v1. · why: With no exporter they would add only dependency and cargo-mutants surface, and bridged span IDs would have no consumer.
decision/panic-hook-first · Panic hook installed first — The panic hook is installed as the first statement of main and writes only to the diagnostics file once that is open, never falling back to stderr.
decision/strict-modes-before-diagnostics · Home strict-modes check before diagnostics — Nothing under the home, the diagnostics directory included, is created or opened before the role's strict-modes check on the home passes; a refused home gets no diagnostics line.
decision/tracing-subscriber-minimal-features · Minimal tracing-subscriber features — tracing-subscriber is taken with default features off and only fmt, json, registry and std; ansi, tracing-log and chrono stay off. · why: The chrono feature only enables ChronoUtc / ChronoLocal, and the millisecond timer uses the root bin's direct chrono dependency.

## product-mode-normal-vs-inverted-self-observing · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/normal-observability-mode · Normal observability mode — viola runs in Normal observability mode: events.ndjson is a product audit log, not a telemetry collector. · why: viola is not a telemetry product; the self-observing-inversion trigger did not fire.

## service-identity · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
contract/process-start/os · the process-start line · os — process-start carries field os, the one word linux.
contract/process-start/pid · the process-start line · pid — process-start carries the process id as field pid.
contract/process-start/service-name · the process-start line · service_name — process-start carries the service name as field service_name.
contract/process-start/version · the process-start line · version — process-start carries the product version as field version.

## 2-telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin telemetry-strategy
overview/2-telemetry-strategy — Structured logs are the primary signal, one JSON-per-line file per process role; spans are declared in code but not serialized in v1, and cross-process joins use corr and conn; errors have no external reporter; metrics have no in-process instruments and no exporter and are derived by jq over the ndjson; events.ndjson is the product audit stream, not a compliance trail, and obs never copies event payloads into process logs.
