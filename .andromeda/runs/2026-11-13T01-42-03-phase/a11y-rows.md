## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
decision/ci-test-gate-no-skips · CI test gate allows no skips — The CI test job's gate requires coverage and doctest and never allows skips.
decision/critical-path-cli-board-output · Critical path: CLI board, wait/last and verify output — The CLI board, wait/last and verify output, with viola list's fixed captions and slot order, is a must-be-accessible critical path.
decision/critical-path-send-readback · Critical path: confirmed send and readback — Confirmed send and readback, or refusal, through the viola send readback mirror [RB] is a must-be-accessible critical path.
contract/cli-refusal/format · CLI refusals · refusal format — A refusal is written to stderr as unable … hint:, giving the reason and detail in text, with a typed exit code.
contract/tui-passthrough/human-keystrokes · viola run TUI passthrough · human keystrokes — Human keystrokes are never blocked, refused or delayed past the current atomic paste.
contract/tui-passthrough/vendor-content · viola run TUI passthrough · vendor content — The rendered content belongs to the vendor claude and is not traced; viola parses it through a vt100 feed, and no conformance claim is made about the claude TUI.
contract/viola-verify/step-line · viola verify output · step line — Each verify step prints a line [NN/NN] … pass|fail.
decision/a11y-tier-standard · A11y tier Standard (1) — The a11y tier is Standard (1): cli and tui get output-discipline and boundary assertions plus manual screen-reader passes, with no WCAG conformance claim.
decision/critical-path-dialog-answer · Critical path: dialog pending, then answer — A pending dialog answered with viola answer (question, permission, plan), including the unverified-cli refusal that withholds answers, is a must-be-accessible critical path.
decision/no-sgr-in-plain-modes · No SGR in plain modes — No SGR, glyph or cursor control is written under `--json`, non-TTY, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, `viola run` or a passed `viola revive`.
decision/output-discipline-stands-in-for-sc · Output discipline stands in for WCAG SC — Output-discipline assertions stand in for SC 1.3.2, 1.4.1 and 3.3.1: meaningful linear order, colour never the sole cue, and the refusal reason and detail given in text. · why: WCAG does not apply directly to terminal output
decision/single-vendor-content-boundary · Single vendor-content boundary — The viola run TUI passthrough, which a passed viola revive also enters, is the only boundary-only vendor-content zone.
decision/static-linear-output · Static linear output — viola's own output is static and linear, with no spinner or redraw.
decision/tui-boundary-assertions-only · TUI boundary assertions only — The tui is asserted only at its boundary, through the portable-pty outer-PTY driver; the result is a boundary guarantee, never a conformance claim.
contract/tui-passthrough/viola-terminal-bytes · viola run TUI passthrough · viola terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes of its own to the terminal; only the child's output reaches it.
contract/tui-passthrough/vt100-feed-panic · viola run TUI passthrough · vt100 feed panic — The boundary still holds after a contained vt100 feed panic: no viola literal reaches the outer terminal, and the child's own bytes still reach it.

## a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin 1-a11y-scope-summary
contract/interrupted-verify/exit · viola verify interrupted · exit 1 — A `verify` stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM before its rows are checked exits 1.
contract/interrupted-verify/stderr · viola verify interrupted · stderr lines — A `verify` stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM before its rows are checked prints no step line and no summary, only `unable: verify was stopped before it finished` and `hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI` last on stderr, plain ASCII.
contract/tui-passthrough/after-feed-panic · TUI passthrough · after a contained vt100 feed panic — The driver's `send` is refused `not-delivered` / `input-not-ready` (exit 13) while a typed human key still reaches the child; none of `panic`, `parse-rejected`, `vt100`, `unable` or `hint:` reaches the outer terminal, and the child's own bytes do.
decision/output-discipline-a11y-fallback · Output-discipline assertions stand in for a11y tools — CLI a11y is checked by output-discipline assertions on the existing CLI drivers (process Command, literal-pinned strings, SGR-only checks through the portable-pty outer PTY), their results machine-parseable through the harness `run` JSON. · why: no automated a11y tool exists for terminal output; a11y tools assume a DOM or native widget tree
contract/tui-passthrough/own-bytes · TUI passthrough · terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes to the terminal except the child's output; a passed `viola revive` writes no line of its own while the child holds the terminal.

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy
decision/human-keystrokes-never-blocked · Human keystrokes never blocked — A human keystroke in `viola run`, or in a start a passed `viola revive` made, is never blocked, refused or delayed past the current atomic paste.
contract/cli-refusal/hint-line · CLI refusal output · hint line — A refusal ends with `hint:` as the last stderr line, carrying a recovery instruction where recovery exists.
contract/cli-refusal/unable-line · CLI refusal output · unable line — A refusal prints `unable  <name>  <reason>  <detail>` on stderr, the plain word followed by plain detail; `viola revive`'s exit-1 refusals, `viola run`'s socket-directory refusal and `viola verify`'s interrupted pair print one `unable: <text>` line instead.
decision/no-sgr-without-tty · No SGR without a colour-capable terminal — The CLI emits no SGR of its own under a non-TTY, `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, `--json`, `viola run` or a passed `viola revive`. · guard: literal pins over std::process::Command and the portable-pty outer PTY on ubuntu-latest

## 4-aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin aria-patterns-roles
decision/linear-static-output · Linear static CLI output — CLI output is linear and static. · guard: literal pins over std::process::Command on ubuntu-latest
decision/cli-output-discipline-assertion-tools · CLI assertable as output discipline — The cli is assertable as output discipline, with no conformance claim, by `std::process::Command` with literal pins and portable-pty outer-PTY SGR checks on the `ubuntu-latest` CI leg.
decision/tui-boundary-only · Tui accessibility is boundary-only — The tui is the vendor `claude` TUI, and viola's accessibility work on it is held only at its boundary, with no landmarks of its own.

## aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin 4-aria-patterns-roles
decision/linear-static-cli-output · Linear static CLI output — CLI output is linear and static, with no spinner, carriage-return redraw, cursor movement or erase sequence; the waiting line appears once on stderr on a terminal and not at all under non-TTY.
decision/no-sgr-off-terminal · No SGR off a terminal — viola emits no SGR of its own under non-TTY, NO_COLOR, TERM=dumb, --json, a passthrough role, viola run or a passed viola revive. · guard: cross_list_rows_print_no_sgr_under_no_color_dumb_piped_or_json

## 5-keyboard-navigation · ## 5. Keyboard Navigation
decision/tui-terminal-belongs-to-child · Tui terminal belongs to the child — On the tui, the terminal belongs to the wrapped child process, not to viola.

## 7-screen-reader-support · ## 7. Screen Reader Support
decision/wrapped-tui-reads-as-unwrapped · Wrapped TUI reads as unwrapped — The wrapped `claude` TUI must read to a screen reader the same as unwrapped. · why: Must-Work O1

## 8-cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin cognitive-accessibility
decision/fixed-cli-strings-pinned · Fixed CLI strings pinned by literal — Every fixed CLI string, hints and result lines included, is pinned by literal. · why: so any copy change fails CI until the pinned string is updated on purpose
decision/no-bare-error-text · No stack trace or bare status as error text — The CLI never shows a stack trace or a bare status number as the only error text.
decision/time-bounds-never-on-human · Time bounds never fall on the human — Every time bound viola holds (wait timeout and cap, dialog hold, send readiness gate, confirmation windows, status-line deadline, agents read, budget pause) falls on the driver, the user's command or viola's child; no key is blocked, refused or delayed by it.
contract/cli-refusal/exit-code · CLI refusal output · exit code — Every refusal ends with a typed exit code.
decision/reason-code-beside-unable · Reason codes always beside unable — Every kebab-case reason or detail code (`not-delivered`, `human-typing`, `unverified-cli`) always sits beside the plain word `unable`.
decision/refusal-layout-literal-pins · Refusal layout held by literal pins — Each refusal's `unable <reason> <detail>` plus final `hint:` layout, its typed exit code and a hint-free `--json` are held by literal asserts in CI on ubuntu-latest. · guard: literal pins over std::process::Command on ubuntu-latest
contract/cli-refusal/json · CLI refusal output · --json — Under `--json` a refusal gives one document with no hint, except the `viola answer` and `viola send` exit-2 paths, which print a fixed stderr line and no document.

## cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin 8-cognitive-accessibility
decision/fixed-cli-strings-pinned-by-literal · Fixed CLI strings pinned by literal — Every fixed CLI string is pinned by a literal in a test, so any copy change fails CI until the pinned string is updated on purpose.
decision/time-bounds-fall-on-the-driver · Time bounds fall on the driver only — Every time bound (MCP wait cap, dialog hold, readiness gate, confirm windows, budget pause, statusline deadline, agents read) falls on the driver or viola's own child, never blocking, refusing or delaying a human key and never moving the wheel.
contract/send-refusal/input-not-ready · viola send refusal · input-not-ready — A send on a verified CLI whose input box is not ready within the readiness gate's wait is refused not-delivered / input-not-ready with nothing typed.
contract/viola-verify/interrupted-pair · viola verify · interrupted pair — unable: verify was stopped before it finished, then hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI.
decision/error-bodies-have-writer-and-witness · Error bodies have a writer and a witness — Each error body names a writer and a witness that stand, and each product error writer is named. · guard: error_bodies_each_name_a_writer_and_a_witness_that_stand
decision/error-word-detail-hint · Errors as word, detail and hint — Every error is a printed word followed by plain detail, and a recovery instruction where recovery exists.
contract/cli-refusal/stderr-layout · CLI refusal · stderr layout — unable  <reason>  <detail> on stderr, then hint: as the last stderr line, with a typed exit code.

## 10-slo-invariants-a11y-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & A11y Budgets
decision/cli-invariants-pass-in-ci · CLI output-discipline invariants pass in CI — The CLI output-discipline invariants (P4, P6) pass on the `ubuntu-latest` CI leg inside the `coverage` suite.
decision/zero-flakiness · Zero flakiness, no retries — Tests and a11y checks run with `retries: 0` and `#[ignore]` banned; a flake keeps the work red until its root cause is fixed. · why: retry-once policies mask real signals (the agent-driven principle)

## 11-a11y-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. A11y Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
decision/no-screen-content-parsing · No screen-content parsing beyond signatures — The rendered `claude` TUI screen is parsed only for compiled input-box and modal signatures, never for other content, and screenshots are never taken as a11y evidence (R7). · why: the rendered TUI is vendor content
decision/no-unwarned-timeouts · No harsh timeouts without warning — No harsh timeout is set without a warn-extend pattern (SC 2.2.1).
decision/machine-output-a11y-review · No human-only a11y review — No a11y review is human-only without machine output. · why: the canonical agent-runnable principle
decision/no-colour-on-failure-words · Failure words are never coloured — The CLI words `unable` and `fail` are never coloured.
decision/refusal-ends-with-hint · Every refusal ends with a hint — Every human-mode CLI refusal ends with a `hint:` recovery line (SC 3.3.3). · except: `unknown` (exit 14), whose detail is a code word or nothing

## a11y-testing-tool-pick · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/cli-a11y-by-literal-tests · CLI a11y checked by literal tests — With no a11y tool for terminal output, output discipline is checked by tests that drive the viola binary as a process and pin each fixed string by a literal.

## ci-integration · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/gate-requires-coverage-doctest · Gate requires coverage and doctest — The test job runs the harness and then gate --require coverage,doctest, with skips never allowed.

## keyboard-test-harness · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/boundary-check-never-inspects-claude-content · Boundary check never inspects claude content — The keyboard boundary check never inspects claude content.
decision/human-key-takes-the-wheel · Human key takes the wheel — A human key during a driver send is delivered unblocked; a key written while a verified send waits in the readiness gate takes the wheel and the send is refused human-typing with nothing typed. · guard: send_under_the_paste_hint_a_human_key_during_the_gate_wait_wins
decision/live-readings-never-gate · Live readings never gate — Live readings of the takeover clause on a real terminal are supplemental and never gating.
decision/zero-viola-bytes-on-the-terminal · Zero viola bytes on the terminal — The outer-PTY stream holds no viola-originated bytes (no message literals, hint:, SGR or cursor control the child did not emit), compared byte for byte with an unwrapped run.
decision/boundary-tests-sequenced-on-records · Boundary tests sequenced on records — The keyboard boundary cases are sequenced on log records, never on a timer, and each boundary clause is its own nextest case.
