## 1-obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin obs-scope-summary
decision/claude-fixtures-scrub-required · Claude fixtures are scrub-required — Build and CI infrastructure is not instrumented, and the claude fixtures are scrub-required data, never a telemetry source. · why: Not product runtime.
decision/diagnostics-owner-only-modes · Diagnostics files are owner-only — Every diagnostics file is mode 0600 inside a 0700 directory.
decision/distinct-detail-code-per-exit-cause · Distinct detail code per exit cause — Each cause behind exit 21 and exit 1 gets a distinct detail code with no path or pid. · except: A strict-modes check refused before any log opens writes no line; its cause is the fixed stderr pair or the --json document.
decision/exit-1-detail-codes · Distinct detail codes for exit-1 causes — On the `viola run` start sequence to child spawn, each exit-1 cause logs a distinct `detail` code with no path or pid in it.
decision/hook-fail-open-silent · Hook fails open silently — Hook fail-open paths log only to `hook-<name>.ndjson` and exit 0 with stderr empty.
decision/hook-log-line-single-append-write · One write per hook log line — Each viola hook log line is one write on an append-mode handle.
decision/hook-logger-init-no-blocking-io · Hook logger init adds no blocking I/O — Logger initialisation in viola hook reads the diagnostics level, runs the strict-modes checks, creates or narrows the home and diagnostics/ to 0700 and opens the role file once for append at 0600, adding no other I/O.
decision/hook-stderr-forbidden · No stderr from hooks — viola hook writes nothing to stderr.
decision/mcp-log-file-sink · MCP logs to a file sink, never stdout — The `mcp` process always logs to the file sink `<home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson`, with no stderr fallback: a file that cannot be opened exits 1 printing nothing, and the log writer is set explicitly. · why: stdout is forbidden because it carries MCP frames
decision/one-log-file-per-role · One log file per process role — Each process role writes its own file under `diagnostics/`, no role has a stdout sink, and no role falls back to stderr JSON when its file cannot be opened.
decision/one-write-per-log-line · One write per log line — Each formatted log line is emitted as a single write on an append-mode handle. · why: Concurrent hook processes share one file.
decision/redaction-not-disableable · Redaction cannot be disabled — No verbosity control, env, flag or config may disable or bypass redaction.
decision/refusal-telemetry · Refusal telemetry for filesystem refusals — Pinned-exe hash mismatches and ignored symlinks produce refusal telemetry.
decision/refused-diagnostics-drops-line · Refused diagnostics file drops its line — A refused `diagnostics/` folder or file is treated as a failed open and its log line is dropped.
decision/send-text-confined · Send text confined to instance diagnostics — `send` text never reaches stderr, `--json`, MCP or any process-log field outside `instances/<name>/diagnostics/`, and each deciding side's `send-refused` carries no text.
decision/send-text-never-logged · Send text never logged — Sent text never appears on stderr, in --json output, in MCP results or in any process-log field outside instances/<name>/diagnostics/.
decision/stderr-fixed-strings · Fixed strings on stderr — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/strict-modes-failure-lines · Where a strict-modes failure is logged — A strict-modes failure has a log line only on the `ledger-stamps` read in the `run` version gate and on `verify`'s own `process-exit` for a refused stamp write.
contract/diagnostics-files/cli · the diagnostics files · cli — Role cli writes <home>/diagnostics/cli-<name>.ndjson, only when an instance resolves.
contract/diagnostics-files/hook · the diagnostics files · hook — Role hook writes <home>/diagnostics/hook-<name>.ndjson, shared by concurrent hook processes; a write failure is swallowed.
contract/diagnostics-files/mcp · the diagnostics files · mcp — Role mcp writes its role file mcp.ndjson in the home's diagnostics folder, which never carries user content; a role file that cannot be opened ends the server with exit 1 and nothing on stderr.
contract/diagnostics-files/run · the diagnostics files · run — Role run writes <home>/diagnostics/run-<name>.ndjson.
contract/process-exit-detail/strict-modes-failed · process-exit detail codes · strict-modes-failed — Carried by `verify`'s `process-exit` for a refused stamp write, with exit 1.
decision/cli-file-sink-only · Short-lived CLI logs to a file sink only — Short-lived CLI verbs log only to a JSON-per-line file sink in diagnostics when an instance resolves, never to stdout. · why: Stdout carries the --json results.
decision/dialog-text-never-logged · Dialog text never logged on answer — On the dialog to `answer` path, the question, answer and tool `input` text never appear in log fields.
decision/hook-log-write-failure-swallowed · Hook log write failure swallowed — A failed write to the hook log is swallowed, so the hook still exits 0 and never writes to stderr.
decision/hook-silent-no-op-without-instance · Hook silent no-op without an instance — Without VIOLA_NAME, on an instance the instance check refuses, or on a VIOLA_DIR naming an instance directory that does not exist, viola hook is a silent no-op: exit 0, no file opened, no line, no frame.
decision/obs-deps-tokio-free · Obs dependencies Tokio-free and C-free — Obs dependencies stay Tokio-free in the sync crates, add no C-building crates and pass cargo deny. · guard: cargo deny
contract/hook-log-file/path · the viola hook log file · path — viola hook logs only to a file sink at diagnostics/hook-<name>.ndjson.
contract/process-exit-detail/socket-dir-refused · process-exit detail codes · socket-dir-refused — Carried by the line of a refused socket directory, where it has one; a refused socket directory is no strict-modes failure.
contract/run-log-file/path · the viola run log file · path — viola run logs only to a file sink at diagnostics/run-<name>.ndjson.

## obs-scope-summary · ## 1. Obs Scope Summary · twin 1-obs-scope-summary
decision/diagnostics-checked-at-open · Diagnostics checked before open — Before a role or detail file is created or narrowed, the existing diagnostics/ folder and the file are checked, a symlink refused and no group or other bit allowed; a refusal is a failed open.
decision/diagnostics-file-modes · Diagnostics file and directory modes — Diagnostics files are 0600 inside 0700 directories. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/diagnostics-owner-only-permissions · Diagnostics owner-only permissions — Files under diagnostics/ are 0600 inside 0700 directories. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/fault-telemetry-per-class · Fault telemetry per class — Each fault class emits its own telemetry: a healed torn ndjson line with file and offset, a corrupt or unsupported snapshot recovered by replay, a child exit seen without EOF, an endpoint vanished during wait, and a stale heartbeat against a live pid.
decision/fixed-stderr-messages · Fixed stderr refusal and fault lines — Refusal and fault lines on stderr are fixed strings with no paths, pids, error chains or upstream text.
decision/fixtures-not-telemetry · Recorded fixtures are no telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are scrub-required data, not a telemetry source, and are excluded from the observability plan. · why: Not product runtime.
decision/linux-only-os-target · Linux-only OS target — The OS target is Linux only: the core on any current distribution, CI on ubuntu-latest.
decision/log-append-atomicity · Append atomicity for concurrent writers — Concurrent hook writers append to a log atomically through POSIX O_APPEND.
decision/no-process-log-without-instance · No process log without an instance — A short-lived CLI verb run with no resolved instance writes no process-log file; its human stderr carries only fixed-message lines, and its outcome is the exit code and stdout.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen · No telemetry from screen content — No telemetry is derived from screen content; vt100 serves gate outcomes only.
decision/process-init-order · Process logging init order — Each process installs its panic hook, parses arguments, resolves home and instance and runs its strict-modes check, opens its diagnostics file append-mode 0600 in a 0700 directory, installs the subscriber, then emits process-start. · why: For run this completes before the start sequence so the collision check and version gate are logged; for mcp, before the stdio transport starts.
decision/redaction-cannot-be-disabled · Redaction cannot be disabled — No environment variable, flag or config setting may disable log redaction.
decision/strict-modes-refusal-writes-no-line · Strict-modes refusal writes no line — A strict-modes check refused before any log opens ends the process with nothing under the home opened and no log line; its cause is carried only by the fixed stderr pair or the --json document. · why: Ratified as the answer to whether a refused strict-modes check logs. · except: The ledger-stamps read in run's version gate and a refused update_stamps in viola verify each leave a line.
contract/cli-frame-verbs/strict-modes-failed · CLI frame verbs · strict-modes-failed — A strict-modes refusal of send, wait, last, answer, pause or release writes no line and prints only the fixed instance pair, or under --json exactly {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}, exit 21, with no pid, path or endpoint.
contract/cli-json-error/strict-modes-failed · CLI --json error document · instance-unreachable strict-modes-failed — A refused instance check of send, wait, last, answer, pause, release, link or unlink exits 21 with the instance pair, or under --json the document {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}.
contract/cli-log-file/revive-start · CLI process-log file · viola revive start arm — Logs as the wrapper, process="run", into diagnostics/run-<name>.ndjson.
contract/dialog-hook/refused-instance-check · Dialog hook · refused instance check — A refused instance check on the dialog hook exits 0 at once with empty streams, no frame and no line.
contract/exit-21-detail/strict-modes-failed · Exit 21 detail codes · strict-modes-failed — strict-modes-failed is a distinct detail code for an exit-21 cause, naming no path or pid.
contract/mcp-frame-tool-refusal/strict-modes-failed · MCP frame tool refusal · strict-modes-failed — A frame tool (send, wait, last, answer) whose instance check refuses returns instance-unreachable with detail strict-modes-failed, writes no frame and no line.
contract/refusal-reason/unknown-fallback · Refusal reason · unknown fallback — An unrecognised RefusalReason falls back to unknown with exit 14.
contract/replayed-snapshot/live-fields · A snapshot.json rebuilt by replay · endpoint, pid, started_at, statusline_command — A snapshot.json rebuilt from events.ndjson carries none of these, so the endpoint reads unreachable, hook connect fails open with channel-unreachable, hook statusline prints nothing, and run's collision check reads the heartbeat alone.
contract/unreachable-cause/strict-modes-failed · exit 21 cause words · strict-modes-failed — One of the closed set of six exit 21 cause words, written into the CLI's --json exit-21 document and MCP's isError body.
contract/viola-link-unlink/strict-modes-failed · viola link and unlink output · strict-modes-failed — A strict-mode fail of the driven instance's check writes no log line; it prints the fixed instance-state unable and hint: pair on stderr, or under --json {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}, and exits 21.
contract/viola-revive/strict-modes-failed · viola revive output · strict-modes-failed — A strict-mode fail of viola revive writes no log line; it prints the stderr pair, or under --json {"v":1,"error":"strict-modes-failed","detail":null}, and exits 1.
contract/viola-verify/home-tree-refused · viola verify · refused home-tree check — A refused home-tree check exits 1 with the home pair, opens no log and writes no line; a refused update_stamps exits 1 with the home pair and, when an instance is named, ends the opened log with a process-exit line carrying detail strict-modes-failed.
decision/detail-codes-no-paths · Detail codes carry no path or pid — No path or pid appears in a detail code.
decision/hook-instance-check-before-obs-init · Hook instance check before logging starts — The hook's event and dialog paths run the instance strict-modes check before reading the diagnostics level and initialising logging. · except: The two --capture arms run ahead of the check.
decision/hook-never-writes-stderr · Hook never writes stderr — A hook process never writes to stderr.
decision/hook-silent-without-trusted-instance · Hook silent without a trusted instance — A hook with no VIOLA_NAME, or whose instance is absent or refused by its strict-modes check, exits 0 with no config read, no stdin read, no log line, no stderr, no frame and no SessionEnd append.
decision/instrument-call-sites-not-os-internals · OS operations instrumented at viola's call sites — OS-level operations (bind, connect, lock, rename, kill fallback, the server check's peer reads, the strict-modes stat reads, the socket directory check) are instrumented at viola's own call sites, not inside the OS.
decision/log-file-basenames-follow-tests · Log file names follow tests — Process-log files are <home>/diagnostics/{run-<name>,hook-<name>,mcp,cli-<name>}.ndjson, as tests require. · why: Tests is upstream; arch and security place diagnostics under the instance directory instead.
decision/mcp-log-sink · MCP log sink — viola mcp always logs to <home>/diagnostics/mcp.ndjson once the home and its diagnostics/ pass strict-modes; a file that cannot be opened exits 1 printing nothing, with no stderr fallback.
decision/messaging-secrets-never-logged · Messaging secrets never logged — CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_TOKEN, CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET and every R8-stripped CLAUDE* value are never logged in any sink, detail files and fixtures included. · guard: secret-scan test
decision/per-parser-parse-failure-counts · Per-parser parse-failure counts — Each parser that drops input (channel framing at MAX_FRAME, the viola mcp stdin at MAX_FRAME, hook stdin, claude agents --json, vt100 under catch_unwind) keeps its own parse-failure count; paste validation refuses a send as not-delivered instead.
decision/skipped-counters · Skipped counters — Unknown event kinds, unknown fields and torn lines are each counted in skipped counters.
decision/structured-json-process-logs · Structured JSON process logs — Every process role (run, hook, mcp, cli) writes structured JSON process logs under diagnostics/, which harness logs merges with events.ndjson.
contract/cli-log-file/link-unlink · CLI process-log file · viola link / viola unlink — Log as cli into the driven instance's cli-<driven>.ndjson, never the caller's VIOLA_NAME, once their instance check of it has passed.
contract/cli-log-file/revive-list · CLI process-log file · viola revive --list — Logs as cli into the caller's cli-<VIOLA_NAME>.ndjson once its strict-modes check has passed; no file with no VIOLA_NAME.
contract/dialog-log-line/unverified-cli · Dialog log line · unverified-cli — The detail unverified-cli goes with exit 12.
contract/hook-fail-open/exit · Hook fail-open · exit — A hook that fails open exits 0 and leaves stderr empty.
contract/mcp-iserror/instance-unreachable · MCP isError result · instance-unreachable — The instance-unreachable detail is one closed cause: strict-modes-failed, instance-dead, unwrapped-name, endpoint-lost, server-verify-failed or socket-dir-refused; the CLI's document less v, its text `refused: instance-unreachable`.
contract/process-log/instance · Process log line · instance — A ViolaName or null.
contract/unreachable-cause/socket-dir-refused · exit 21 cause words · socket-dir-refused — One of the closed set of six exit 21 cause words, written into the CLI's --json exit-21 document and MCP's isError body.
contract/wait-log-line/exit-code-21 · Wait log line · exit_code 21 — A wait exits 21 when the wrapper is killed mid-wait (detail endpoint-lost, during call), or when a CLI wait meets a refused socket directory before any frame (detail socket-dir-refused, during connect, no channel-request).

## 2-telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin telemetry-strategy
decision/one-line-panic-record · One structured line per panic — Every panic after init step 4 produces exactly one single-line structured record in its home-level role file with location, thread, role and instance; payload and backtrace go only to the instance-scoped detail file. · except: the bounded panic exemptions listed in the plan's Section 10
contract/process-log-line/enum-values · the process log line · enum values — Enum values are kebab-case.

## telemetry-strategy · ## 2. Telemetry Strategy · twin 2-telemetry-strategy
decision/pre-open-strict-modes-refusal-silent · Strict-modes refusal before a log opens writes no line — A strict-modes refusal made before any process log opens writes no line and carries no logged detail code; its machine-readable form is the exit code and, under --json, its closed document. · except: a refused socket directory always logs detail socket-dir-refused, except at MCP's frame tool, which writes no line
contract/strict-modes-refusal-exit/1 · strict-modes refusal exit codes · 1 — run, revive's start and verify exit 1 on a strict-modes refusal; revive under --json prints the strict-modes-failed document.
contract/strict-modes-refusal-exit/21 · strict-modes refusal exit codes · 21 — The six frame verbs and link / unlink exit 21 on a strict-modes refusal, under --json with the instance-unreachable document carrying detail strict-modes-failed.
decision/hook-silent-without-instance · Hook silent without an instance — A hook with no VIOLA_NAME, or with a refused or absent instance, exits 0 at once and writes no file, no line and no frame.
decision/panic-one-line-record · One single-line record a panic — Every panic after obs init produces exactly one single-line structured record in its home-level role file, with location, thread, role and instance; payload and backtrace go only to the instance-scoped detail file. · except: the pre-init window and the paths that refuse or lack an instance or home tree before their role file opens
decision/structured-logs-primary-signal · Structured logs are the primary signal — tracing-subscriber JSON-per-line logs, one file per process role under the home's diagnostics directory, are the primary observability signal, merged with the event stream by agent-run logs.
contract/socket-dir-refused-exit/codes · socket-dir-refused exit codes · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory logs detail socket-dir-refused with no path, pid or uid, and exits 21 at the eight CLI frame verbs and 1 at run and revive's start.

## 3-observability-harness-contract · ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/codes-only-process-logs · Codes-only process logs, content in detail files — Every role's codes-only process log goes to its home-level role file under diagnostics, and content-bearing detail goes only to the instance's per-role detail file.
contract/list-stderr/unable-hint-pair · viola list stderr · unable / hint pair — The unable / hint: pair carries no SGR colour codes.
contract/revive-list-stderr/refusal-pair · viola revive --list stderr · refusal pair — viola revive --list writes the refusal pair for its two refusals and nothing else on stderr.
contract/run-terminal-output/start-refusal · run terminal output · start refusal — A start refusal before any child is spawned writes exactly two fixed stderr lines with no path or pid: the home pair for a home-level refusal, the instance pair for an instance-level one.
decision/short-lived-verbs-stderr · Short-lived verbs use stderr for humans — Short-lived CLI verbs may use stderr for their human output.

## 4-span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin span-trace-coverage
decision/detail-codes-only · detail is a closed code — The detail field is a closed kebab-case code catalog and never carries a path or pid.
decision/no-endpoint-over-replayed-snapshot · No endpoint over a replayed snapshot — Over a replayed or absent snapshot read, endpoint lookup and the hook connect give no endpoint, so no frame is sent, and the statusline runs no command. · guard: edge test E5
decision/unreadable-ledger-is-unverified · Unreadable ledger counts as unverified — A missing stamp, or an unreadable, malformed or strict-modes-refused capability ledger, counts as unverified (cli_verified false).
contract/cli-wait-last-connect/strict-modes-failed · CLI wait / last connect refusal · strict-modes-failed — A home or instance tree refused by the instance check, checked first, ends the call before any role file opens with exit 21 and no line; under --json the output is exactly {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}.
contract/mcp-wait-last-connect/strict-modes-failed · MCP wait / last connect refusal · strict-modes-failed — A home or instance tree refused by the instance check returns instance-unreachable with detail strict-modes-failed and writes no line.
contract/state-recovered-detail/snapshot-replayed · state-recovered detail · snapshot-replayed — A state-recovered line at WARN carries this detail, one line per snapshot read call.
contract/viola-verify-refusal/home-tree-refused · viola verify strict-modes refusal · home tree refused — Before logging, verify holds the home, ledger/, bin/ and plugin/ to the strict-modes check; a refused tree exits 1 with the home pair and writes no line.
contract/viola-verify-refusal/stamp-write-refused · viola verify strict-modes refusal · stamp write refused — A ledger/stamps.json the stamp write refuses prints the home pair and exits 1 through verify's own process-exit line.
decision/ci-verify-fake-agent-only · CI verify against the fake agent only — In CI, viola verify runs only against the fake agent.
decision/link-verbs-log-to-driven-instance · Link verbs log to the driven instance — The viola link and viola unlink verbs log into the driven instance's cli-<driven>.ndjson, their request inside the cli.link / cli.unlink span.
contract/cli-wait-last-connect/socket-dir-refused · CLI wait / last connect refusal · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory, checked before the server comparison, ends the call before any frame with exit 21 and one WARN process-exit line (during connect), and no channel-request line.
contract/mcp-wait-last-connect/socket-dir-refused · MCP wait / last connect refusal · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory returns instance-unreachable with detail socket-dir-refused and writes no line.

## span-trace-coverage · ## 4. Span / Trace Coverage · twin 4-span-trace-coverage
decision/cli-log-only-under-viola-name · cli process log only under a parsed name — A short-lived cli verb opens its process log and writes process-start and process-exit only when an instance resolves: for list, plugin install and revive --list under a parsed VIOLA_NAME (with no name no log), for the frame verbs under the named target (link and unlink the driven) instance.
decision/dialog-hook-fails-open · Dialog hook fails open on a failed check — A dialog hook whose instance, socket-directory, euid or server check fails emits no decision and sends no frame, so the dialog falls back to the human.
decision/home-tree-check-before-start-log · Home-tree check before the start's log — The start of run and of viola revive checks the home tree (the home, instance set, ledger, bin, plugin, pinned exe and plugin hooks) before its log opens; a refusal exits 1 with the home or instance pair, opens no log, writes no line and starts no child.
decision/hook-refused-instance-silent · Refused instance makes the hook silent — On the event and dialog paths the instance check runs before the diagnostics level and log init; a refused or unresolved instance exits 0 at once with no config read, no role file, no stdin read, no line, no frame and no SessionEnd append.
decision/no-raw-snapshot-reads · Product readers read the snapshot through replay — Every product reader of the snapshot uses the replaying read; no product reader reads the snapshot raw.
decision/refused-check-writes-no-line · A refused check opens no process log — A cli verb whose strict-modes, tree or instance check refuses (exit 21) opens no process log and writes no line.
decision/refused-home-tree-writes-no-line · Refused home tree writes no line — verify and plugin install check the home tree before their log opens, and a refused tree opens no log and writes no line.
decision/replayed-snapshot-unreachable · Replayed snapshot is unreachable — Only a snapshot read whole leads to a connect; a replayed or absent snapshot is treated as unreachable and no frame is sent. · why: A replayed snapshot carries no endpoint, pid or started_at.
decision/unreadable-ledger-means-unverified · Unreadable capability ledger means an unverified CLI — A capability ledger that is missing a stamp, unreadable, malformed or refused by the strict-modes check is treated as an unverified CLI (cli_verified false).
contract/answer-refusal/not-delivered · driver-side answer refusal · not-delivered — channel-response{result_class:"refusal"} with no refusal word and no detail on the line, exit 13.
contract/answer-refusal/unverified-cli · driver-side answer refusal · unverified-cli — refusal unverified-cli, exit 12, the answer withheld.
contract/cli-exit-21/instance-dead · cli exit 21 process-exit · instance-dead — detail instance-dead with during connect: no live snapshot, a replayed one included, or the connect failed.
contract/cli-stderr/refusal-pair · CLI stderr · unable and hint pair — A refusal is printed to stderr as a fixed "unable:" line followed by a "hint:" line.
contract/diag-line-schema/os · diag-line v1 schema · os — os is closed to linux.
contract/instance-unreachable-json/strict-modes-failed · cli --json refusal document · strict-modes-failed — A refused instance check exits 21 with the instance pair on stderr, or under --json exactly {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}, and sends no frame.
contract/mcp-instance-unreachable/strict-modes-failed · viola mcp frame tool refusal · strict-modes-failed — A refused instance check, run before the live endpoint is read, returns instance-unreachable with detail strict-modes-failed, no frame and no line.
contract/mcp-refusal-text/instance-unreachable · viola mcp wait and last refusal · strict-modes-failed body — MCP wait and last refused by the instance check return the cli document less v (error instance-unreachable, detail strict-modes-failed), their text refused: instance-unreachable, with no line.
contract/no-endpoint-instance/classification · no-endpoint instance reading · instance-dead or unwrapped-name — An instance with no endpoint whose path is a directory reads instance-dead; anything else (absent, a regular file, a symlink) reads unwrapped-name; the reading writes no line and the instance check stays first.
contract/plugin-install-exit-codes/21 · plugin install exit codes · 21 — The strict-modes tree check refused; no log is opened and no line is written, with the stderr pair or, under --json, the instance-unreachable document.
contract/refusal-stderr-pair/socket-dir-refused · cli refusal stderr pair · socket-directory refusal — Printed on start and frame-verb refusals in plain ASCII with hint: last and no SGR, naming only the parsed ViolaName.
contract/run-log-parse-rejected/ledger-stamps · the run process log parse-rejected line · parser ledger-stamps — An unreadable, malformed or strict-modes-refused capability ledger gives one parse-rejected line with parser "ledger-stamps", detail "unreadable", "malformed" or "strict-modes-failed", and a count, in the run log.
contract/state-recovered/snapshot-replayed · state-recovered line · snapshot-replayed — state-recovered{detail:"snapshot-replayed", file:"snapshot.json"} at WARN with no corr for an unreadable snapshot, one line per call; none for a present or absent snapshot, and none when the replay itself fails.
contract/verify-process-exit/strict-modes-failed · verify process-exit line · detail strict-modes-failed — A stamps store refused by its strict-modes check, under a parsed VIOLA_NAME, ends with process-exit carrying detail "strict-modes-failed" and the home pair on stderr.
contract/verify-stop-stderr/unable-hint-pair · verify stderr on a stop · the stop pair — A stopped verify prints exactly "unable: verify was stopped before it finished" and "hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI" on stderr, with empty stdout and no stamp written.
decision/clients-screen-peer-replies-to-code-words · Clients screen peer replies to code words and a fixed fault — The CLI and MCP clients screen a peer reply before using it: a refusal and its detail must be code words, a wrapper fault keeps only its code, a fixed message and closed data, and the screening adds no span and no line. · why: No path or upstream text may cross from a wrapper into a document, a tool result or a log.
decision/error-chain-in-detail-log-only · Full error chain only in the cli detail log — The full anyhow error chain of a cli verb goes to the cli detail log only.
decision/hook-always-exits-zero · viola hook keeps exit 0 — viola hook exits 0 even when its dispatch panics: a panic around dispatch is caught.
decision/implicit-link-on-send-and-answer · Implicit link recorded by send and answer — An issued send or a taken answer whose from names an instance other than the wrapper records the link, one link product line for a new pair; a refused call, one with no from, or one under the wrapper's own name records nothing.
decision/instance-check-before-role-file · Instance check before any role file — The frame verbs run the instance check on their named instance (the driven instance for link and unlink) before any role file opens.
decision/no-dialog-content-in-logs · Dialog content never logged — The question, the answer and the tool input never appear in a log line.
decision/no-last-assistant-message · last_assistant_message never logged — last_assistant_message never appears in a log line.
decision/no-text-in-telemetry · Sent text never in telemetry — The sent text never appears in a span or log line; only its length does.
decision/real-cli-verify-never-in-ci · Real-CLI verify never runs in CI — In CI verify runs only against the fake agent; the real-CLI verify runs only through the local live run, which refuses under CI.
decision/revive-start-logs-as-run · viola revive start logs as run — The start arm of viola revive is not a cli verb and logs as process run once its instance check has passed.
decision/socket-dir-check-changes-no-mode · Socket-directory check repairs nothing — The socket-directory check on the recorded endpoint's parent changes no mode: a refused directory stays as found.
decision/statusline-silent-without-instance · Statusline arm silent without a valid instance — The statusline arm writes no line without a valid VIOLA_NAME or when the instance check refuses: it returns exit 0 at once with no role file opened.
decision/unreadable-budget-reads-as-none · Bad budget file reads as no reading — A refused, unreadable, over-cap or other-version budget file reads as no reading.
decision/verify-lines-carry-no-content · verify log lines carry no content — No verify log line carries row text, a prompt, a session id, the probe command, a status line payload or a path.
contract/cli-exit-21/socket-dir-refused · cli exit 21 process-exit · socket-dir-refused — A frame verb meeting a refused socket directory writes one process-exit{exit_code:21, detail:"socket-dir-refused", during:"connect"} at WARN inside its dispatch span, with no channel-request line and no frame.
contract/run-span-attributes/run-collision-check · viola run start span attributes · run.collision_check — outcome is free or already-live; a live or stale holder is already-live, a gone one free; over a replayed snapshot a beat no older than STALE_AFTER is already-live, an older one free; an absent snapshot or failed read is free.
contract/run-start-failure-detail/already-live · run start process-exit · already-live — process-exit{subject:"self", exit_code:1, detail:"already-live"} for a live holder or a fresh replayed beat, with no path or pid.
contract/send-refused-client/control-character · client-side send validation refusal · control-character — Made before any frame: send-refused{corr:null, refusal:"not-delivered", detail:"control-character", side:"client"}, one line per deciding side, never the text.
contract/send-refused/budget-paused · wrapper send-refused · budget-paused — send-refused{corr:<cursor>, refusal:"budget-paused", detail:"five-hour"|"seven-day", window, used_percentage, resets_at, paused:true}, with client exit_code 11.
contract/send-refused/human-typing · wrapper send-refused · human-typing — send-refused{corr:<cursor>, refusal:"human-typing", detail:null|"manual-pause", wheel:"human", side:"wrapper"}, with the client process-exit{exit_code:10}.
contract/verify-exit-codes/1 · verify exit codes · 1 — A row failed, verify refused, or verify was stopped.

## 6-log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin log-coverage
decision/skipped-symlink-never-logged · Skipped symlink never named in logs — The entry name and link target of a skipped symlink are never logged.
contract/log-levels/warn · log levels · warn — WARN carries state-recovered; parse-rejected; hook-decision with a fail-open detail; process-exit with exit 21; channel-response with -32600 or -32602.
decision/file-only-per-role-log-sinks · File-only log sinks per role — Diagnostics are written to files only, one sink per role, under the home's diagnostics directory.
contract/log-levels/info · log levels · info — INFO carries all other boundary, lifecycle and state-transition events, including refusals, which are normal product outcomes.
contract/log-line/instance · every log line · instance — The ViolaName; the key is absent when there is none.

## log-coverage · ## 6. Log Coverage · twin 6-log-coverage
decision/symlink-skip-logged-as-count · Skipped state entries logged as a parse-rejected count — A scan of instance state that skips a symlinked or malformed entry writes one parse-rejected line with parser state-entry, detail symlink-ignored or malformed and a count, once per scan, at warn, into the scanning process's role file, naming no entry and no link target. · why: A skipped symlink has no exit or decision to carry it.
contract/diag-detail/strict-modes-failed · diagnostic detail words · strict-modes-failed — Written on the process-exit exit 1 of viola verify under a parsed VIOLA_NAME and on parse-rejected ledger-stamps from the version gate of run, at warn, with no path; every other refused strict-modes check writes no log line, its exit code or JSON document its only record.
contract/diag-line-fields/parse-rejected · diagnostic line additive fields · parse-rejected — parser (claude-agents-json, vt100-feed, config-json, ledger-stamps, hook-stdin, channel-frame, mcp-stdin, state-entry), detail, count.
contract/diag-line-fields/state-recovered · diagnostic line additive fields · state-recovered — detail (torn-line-healed, snapshot-replayed, snapshot-unsupported-v), file (basename only), offset (torn-line-healed only), v_seen (snapshot-unsupported-v only), scanned (snapshot details only: the instance name when valid, never a path or null).
contract/hook-decision-detail/channel-unreachable · hook-decision detail · channel-unreachable — Written when the channel cannot be reached, a replayed or absent snapshot included; no frame is sent, the hook fails open and SessionEnd takes its direct append.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/strict-modes-failed · parse-rejected detail · strict-modes-failed — ledger-stamps: run's version gate refused the stamps file on the strict-modes check, and the read counts as unverified.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/symlink-ignored · parse-rejected detail · symlink-ignored — state-entry.
contract/process-exit-detail/verify-refusal · process-exit detail · viola verify refusal — Under a parsed VIOLA_NAME, verify writes its refusal code: program-not-found, pinned-hash-mismatch, version-unreadable, strict-modes-failed, unclean-fixture or interrupted; a failing row carries no code.
contract/send-refused-detail/refusal-reason-words · send-refused detail · RefusalReason detail words — Refusal details are the arch RefusalReason details verbatim: manual-pause, five-hour, seven-day, input-not-ready, no-prompt-submitted, turn-running, unknown-dialog, control-character, empty-text.
decision/unemittable-schema-words-removed · Schema words no build can emit are removed — A closed word of the diag-line schema that no build can emit leaves the schema with its emitter; os is closed at linux.
contract/diag-detail/socket-dir-refused · diagnostic detail words · socket-dir-refused — A closed detail on process-exit and hook-decision for a socket dir refused as a symlink, no directory, foreign owner or mode bit: run and revive's start write process-exit exit 1, CLI frame verbs process-exit exit 21 during connect at WARN, viola hook a hook-decision at WARN; MCP writes none.
contract/hook-decision-detail/fail-open-codes · hook-decision detail · fail-open codes — oversize-stdin, malformed-json, channel-unreachable, server-verify-failed, socket-dir-refused, deadline; no hook arm writes strict-modes-failed or unverified-cli.
contract/hook-decision-detail/statusline-codes · hook-decision detail · statusline codes — viola hook statusline writes only oversize-stdin, malformed-json and deadline; a refused instance check writes no line.
contract/parse-rejected-detail/unreadable · parse-rejected detail · unreadable — config-json, ledger-stamps.
contract/process-exit-detail/exit-1 · process-exit detail · exit 1 — already-live, stale-heartbeat, squatted-name, pinned-hash-mismatch, internal-error, socket-dir-refused, and from revive's preflight no-session, session-live, cwd-missing; each one process-exit line with no child started.
contract/process-exit-detail/exit-21 · process-exit detail · exit 21 — instance-dead, unwrapped-name, endpoint-lost, server-verify-failed, socket-dir-refused.
contract/send-refused-detail/empty-text · send-refused detail · empty-text — Written for an empty typed text on send; the word adds no field, and send-refused detail stays an open string in the diag-line schema.

## 7-error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin error-capture-reporting
decision/boundary-errors-end-in-logged-line · Crate-seam errors end in a logged line — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam ends in a logged process-exit detail, channel-response error, hook-decision detail or send-refused line, carrying codes only at WARN or ERROR.
decision/instance-unreachable-not-logged · instance-unreachable logged by no line — An MCP instance-unreachable reject, from any instance, liveness, socket-directory, euid or server-verification check, is logged by no line; the isError code is its only record.
decision/typed-errors-fixed-display · Typed errors with fixed Display messages — Every typed error has a fixed-message Display, written with thiserror, and holds no fields with paths or payloads. · except: PtyError's Display is hand-written, as viola-pty takes no thiserror.
contract/panic-outcome-by-role/cli · panic outcome by role · cli — After a panic, cli logs process-exit{subject:"self", exit_code:1, detail:"internal-error"} when an instance resolves, puts the chain in the detail file only, writes exactly "error: internal error\n" on stderr in one write with no hint, and exits 1.
decision/mcp-rejects-codes-only · MCP rejects are codes only — MCP rejects are isError codes only, and a logged reject's line holds codes only.

## error-capture-reporting · ## 7. Error Capture & Reporting · twin 7-error-capture-reporting
decision/mcp-unreachable-carries-one-cause-word · Each MCP unreachable result carries one cause word — Each MCP unreachable outcome (a refused check, a dead or unwrapped instance, a lost endpoint, an unverified server or a refused socket directory) carries exactly one UnreachableCause word as its detail. · why: The MCP process writes no exit line for it, so the result's cause word is the cause's only record for the calling agent.
decision/peer-replies-screened-as-code-words · Peer replies screened as code words — A peer reply's refusal and detail are kept only as code words (1-64 bytes of [a-z0-9-], letter first); an unknown code word stays visible and exits 14. · why: by design
decision/pre-log-strict-refusals-write-no-line · Strict-modes refusals before the log opens write no line — Refusals of the instance and home-tree checks that run before a role file opens write no line in any log and open nothing under the home. · why: Opening a log narrows the home and would erase the refused state; the strict-modes negative tests assert that no diagnostics folder appears.
decision/refused-diagnostics-path-is-a-failed-open · A refused diagnostics path is a failed open — A refused diagnostics folder or file is exactly a failed open: the role file does not open, and a detail line is dropped with nothing written and nothing on stderr. · why: The hook carries on with no subscriber, the other roles end as an internal error, and no line is ever written through a widened folder or a symlink.
contract/answer-send-exit-2/stderr-line · viola answer and viola send exit 2 · stderr line — Exit 2 writes the fixed unusable-response or unusable-text line to stderr whatever --json says, with no document.
contract/cli-internal-error/human-line · cli internal error · error: internal error — Without --json the cli catch site prints exactly error: internal error; run, revive's start, mcp and hook print neither.
contract/exit-21-document/detail · exit 21 document · detail — One of six closed words: strict-modes-failed, instance-dead, unwrapped-name, endpoint-lost, server-verify-failed, socket-dir-refused.
contract/mcp-frame-tools/strict-modes-failed · viola mcp frame tools · strict-modes-failed — A refused instance check returns isError instance-unreachable with detail strict-modes-failed, and writes no frame and no line.
decision/not-a-directory-refusal-message-fixed · NotADirectory refusal message is fixed and pathless — The NotADirectory strict-modes refusal reads the fixed message "a trusted state path is not a directory" and names no path. · why: The security plan's fixed-message rule keeps paths out of error text, and the fixed-messages unit test pins every refusal's text.
contract/mcp-frame-tools/socket-dir-refused · viola mcp frame tools · socket-dir-refused — A refused socket directory returns isError instance-unreachable with detail socket-dir-refused, and writes no frame and no line.

## 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/fixed-error-messages · Fixed error messages — Error Display texts are fixed, and serde-sourced error chains are mapped to fixed messages at dispatch.
decision/home-level-lines-path-free · Home-level lines path-free — Home-level log lines are path-free: file fields are basenames, panic_location is workspace-relative and source file recording is off; absolute paths appear only in detail files. · why: The OS username inside absolute paths is the only PII in scope.
decision/no-regex-scrubbers · No regex scrubbers — Sensitive data is never scrubbed by regular expressions. · why: viola's sensitive data is known by type
decision/payload-types-derive-redact · Type-level redaction of payload types — Every channel, hook and MCP payload type derives veil Redact, so Debug never reveals content.
decision/veil-redact-second-layer · veil Redact as the second redaction layer — veil's derive Redact is the second redaction layer, so a stray value capture prints [REDACTED] instead of content.
decision/veil-toggle-feature-banned · veil toggle feature banned — veil's non-default toggle feature, which lets redaction be disabled at runtime, is never enabled. · guard: cargo-deny bans.features entry denying toggle on veil
decision/content-only-in-detail-file · Content-bearing records only in the detail file — Content-bearing records go only to the instance-scoped detail-<process>.ndjson file.
decision/default-deny-log-fields · Default-deny for logged fields — A field is logged only if it is named in the obs plan's event catalog; an unknown field is a build failure. · guard: gate G4 against schemas/diag-line.v1.json
decision/low-class-metadata-as-typed-fields · Low-class metadata as typed fields — Low-class metadata is logged as typed fields, never inside detail codes.
decision/schema-top-level-unevaluated-properties · Default-deny schema via top-level unevaluatedProperties — The diagnostics line schema enforces default-deny with a top-level unevaluatedProperties false over per-event field lists. · why: in JSON Schema 2020-12 additionalProperties does not see properties declared inside allOf or if-then · guard: contract_diag_schema
decision/source-allow-list-logging · Source allow-list for logged fields — Spans skip all arguments and declare fields explicitly, and events go through obs_event! with explicit typed fields only; this source allow-list is the primary PII control. · guard: disallowed-macros; raw_event_hits; G1 bare instrument

## pii-scrubbing-compliance · ## 8. PII Scrubbing & Compliance · twin 8-pii-scrubbing-compliance
decision/closed-protocol-codes · Closed protocol codes — Protocol codes and refusal details are logged as closed kebab-case enums naming no param or value. · guard: answer_invalid_params_names_its_cause_and_no_param
decision/content-sink-behind-strict-check · Content sink behind a strict-modes check — The diagnostics content sink opens only after a strict-modes check of the folder and file; a symlink or a folder or file another user may read refuses the open as a failed open and the detail line is dropped. · why: High-class content is never written through a symlink or into a folder another user may read.
decision/error-messages-interpolate-nothing · Error messages interpolate nothing — thiserror messages interpolate no value. · guard: thiserror_messages_interpolate_nothing
decision/fixtures-not-a-telemetry-source · Fixtures not a telemetry source — Recorded fixtures are not a telemetry source, and observability adds no fixture content.
decision/server-verify-refusal-names-nothing · Server-verify refusal names nothing — A server-verification refusal carries no pid, start time, path or endpoint in any output or log line. · guard: security_negatives_server_identity
decision/socket-dir-refusal-names-nothing · Socket-directory refusal names nothing — A socket-directory refusal carries no path, pid or uid in its lines and documents, and its human pair names only the parsed instance name. · guard: security_negatives_socket_dir
decision/veil-redaction · veil derives redaction — veil 0.3.0's derived Redact is what redacts the payload fields of contract types, and instrumented spans skip all arguments.
decision/agent-rows-never-verbatim · Agent rows never logged verbatim — claude agents --json rows are untrusted and never logged verbatim, only parse-rejected counts.

## 9-ci-integration · ## 9. CI Integration · twin ci-integration
decision/ci-on-github-actions · CI on GitHub Actions — CI runs on GitHub Actions in one push and pull-request workflow on an ubuntu-latest matrix, beside a scheduled nightly workflow for advisory checks and fuzzing; there is no OTLP collector job.

decision/banned-telemetry-dependencies · Banned telemetry and logging dependencies — opentelemetry-otlp, opentelemetry-stdout, sentry, tracing-appender, the tracing-subscriber env-filter feature and the veil toggle feature are not taken as dependencies. · guard: cargo deny check
decision/os-gated-test-census · OS-gated test census — Every OS-gated test function or file must be named in the census with a non-empty reason, and a gate predicate naming windows or macos is a fault even when named. · guard: contract_os_gated_tests

## 10-slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & Telemetry Budgets · twin slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets
decision/deterministic-emission · Deterministic event emission — Events key on hook events and events.ndjson offsets; nothing is derived from screen content. · except: The readiness gate reads the vt100 screen before a paste, and its verdict can refuse a send as input-not-ready.
decision/diagnostics-files-mode-0600 · Diagnostics files are 0600 — A diagnostics file whose mode is not 0600 counts as an SLO invariant failure.
decision/module-boundary-error-logging · Errors logged once at module boundaries — Every typed error that crosses a crate seam is logged once at WARN or ERROR with a closed detail or error_code; the full chain goes only to the instance detail file.
decision/cargo-deny-failure-fails · cargo deny failure is a failure — A cargo deny failure (Tokio, a C crate, veil toggle, banned obs crates) counts as an SLO invariant failure. · guard: cargo deny
decision/zero-unlogged-panics · Zero unlogged panics — Every panic in run, hook, mcp and cli after init step 4 produces exactly one single-line ERROR panic record in its home-level role file, with no multi-line backtrace there, and hook still exits 0; retry-once policies for panic handling are forbidden. · guard: G2 · except: the bounded exemptions where no file exists, so no line can be written; G2 alone leaves out the fake-agent seam's deliberate panic from its count.

## slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets · ## 10. SLO Invariants & Telemetry Budgets · twin 10-slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets
contract/hook-decision/channel-unreachable · Hook decision line · channel-unreachable — A hook whose snapshot read is replayed or absent fails open as channel-unreachable.

## 11-obs-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. Obs Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these) · twin obs-anti-patterns
decision/no-paths-or-pids-in-detail-codes · No paths or pids in detail codes — detail codes never contain paths or pids.
decision/no-telemetry-from-screen-content · No telemetry from screen content — Telemetry is never derived from screen content; vt100 is used for readiness and modal gate outcomes only.
decision/paths-only-in-instance-detail-files · Paths only in instance detail files — Paths appear only in instance detail files.
decision/scrub-before-bytes-leave-process · Scrubbing before any byte leaves the process — Every byte is scrubbed of secrets before it leaves the process; in v1 the only destination is local files. · guard: the secret-scan test
decision/veil-toggle-banned · veil toggle feature banned — veil's toggle feature (VEIL_DISABLE_REDACTION / veil::disable()) is never enabled. · guard: cargo-deny
decision/event-values-closed · event values closed — No event value is added without a Decisions Log entry.
decision/file-sink-only-error-sink · File sink is the only error sink — Local logs are never optional: the file sink is the only error sink and works with every other feature off.
decision/must-trace-paths-always-traced · Must-trace paths always traced — Spans and events are never skipped on the 6 must-trace paths. · why: The agent loses its ability to debug without them.
decision/obs-event-macro-only · obs_event! is the only event macro — tracing's event and level macros are never called directly outside viola_core::obs; events go through obs_event!. · why: Only obs_event! guarantees event, process and instance. · guard: clippy disallowed-macros; the raw-event! grep in lint-probes
contract/stdout-by-role/cli · stdout by role · cli — stdout carries the --json results.

## bootstrap-phases-derive-for-route-setup-project · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/fixed-error-display · Fixed error Display text — Typed errors have fixed Display text that carries no interpolated content.
decision/veil-redact-payload-types · veil redacts payload types — Payload types derive veil's Redact, and cargo deny bans veil's toggle feature. · guard: cargo deny veil toggle ban
decision/obs-event-single-macro · One obs_event macro for every line — Every log line is emitted through the one obs_event macro defined in viola-core, which expands to tracing's event at the caller, so viola-core stays I/O-free and tracing-free.
decision/raw-tracing-ban · Raw tracing macros banned — The tracing level macros are banned by clippy disallowed-macros and raw event calls by a fail-closed grep outside the obs module, so only obs_event emits lines. · why: clippy reports a disallowed macro expanded inside an exported macro at the caller, so no allow inside obs_event can exempt it · guard: clippy disallowed-macros and scripts/lint-probes.sh

## log-file-location · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/log-files-owner-only · Owner-only log files — Log files are created 0600 inside 0700 directories. · guard: secret-scan test
contract/diagnostics-files/paths · diagnostics files · process log paths — Process logs are written to <home>/diagnostics/ as run-<name>, hook-<name>, mcp and cli-<name> .ndjson files, and detail to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson.

## log-format-json-schema · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
contract/process-log-line/process · the process log line · process — One of run, hook, mcp, cli; cli is a short-lived verb with a resolved instance, writing cli-<name>.ndjson.
contract/corr-by-event/parse-rejected · corr by event · parse-rejected — corr is null.
contract/corr-by-event/send · corr by event · send-issued, send-confirmed, send-refused — corr is the send cursor; a wrapper refusal before send-issued carries the target's event-stream end offset, never returned to the caller; wrapper send lines carry conn and rpc_id; the client-side send-refused has corr null.
contract/corr-by-event/state-recovered · corr by event · state-recovered — corr is null.
contract/process-log-line/message · the process log line · message — The message is a static literal equal to the event name and never carries interpolated content.

## logging-stack · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/shared-log-files-concurrent-append · Concurrent appends to shared diagnostics files — Every diagnostics file may have concurrent writers in separate processes; each line is one whole write on an append-mode handle, readers tolerate a torn line, and a concurrent-append check, including a detail line over 4 KiB, asserts every line parses. · why: Non-interleaving at this size is an assumption, not a POSIX guarantee, because the 4 KiB PIPE_BUF rule applies to pipes. · guard: concurrent-append check; hook_panics_append_whole_lines_over_4_kib_side_by_side
contract/diagnostics-files/detail · the diagnostics files · detail — Content-bearing records (full error chains, drift reports, panic payload and backtrace) go only to <home>/instances/<name>/diagnostics/detail-<process>.ndjson, file 0600 in a 0700 directory, and only when an instance resolves.
contract/diagnostics-line/format · the diagnostics line · format — Each diagnostics line is one structured JSON object on one line, written whole by one write of the complete line on an append-mode handle.
decision/level-changes-volume-only · Level changes volume only — Every diagnostics level uses the same field allow-list, so the level changes only how many lines are written. · why: No setting can disable redaction.
decision/no-internal-error-fallback · No stderr fallback for subscriber internal errors — The diagnostics subscriber never reports its own internal errors by printing to stderr. · why: The default falls back to eprintln, which would break the Hook contract and the run terminal rule.
contract/diagnostics-line/role-file-line-size · the diagnostics line · role-file line size — A line in a role file (run, hook, mcp, cli) is codes-only and stays well under 4 KiB.

## otel-sdk-init · key of ## 3. Observability Harness Contract
decision/failed-log-open-discards · Failed log open discards lines — When the role file cannot be opened, viola_obs_init returns the error and installs no subscriber, so no line is written; hook carries on and the other roles, mcp included, return the error.
decision/home-tree-check-before-log-init · Home tree check before log init — run, revive's start arm and viola verify check the home tree's modes before their log opens; a refusal writes no line, starts no child, leaves modes as found and exits 1.
decision/hook-refusal-exits-zero · Refused hook fails open — A hook whose instance is refused or absent exits 0 at once, reading nothing under the home and no stdin, writing no frame and no log line.
decision/instance-check-before-log-init · Instance check before log init — Commands acting on an instance (revive's start arm, the hook arms, link, unlink, send, wait, last, answer, pause, release) run the instance strict-modes check before opening any log; a refusal opens and writes nothing and leaves modes as found. · why: Opening the role file narrows an existing home to 0700, so a check made after it passes a home at 0770. · except: The two hook --capture arms run ahead of the check.
decision/lazy-detail-file · Detail file opened lazily — The instance detail file is opened only by the first content-bearing record or by the panic hook, and a failed detail open drops only the detail line, writing nothing to stderr. · why: The error-free hook path keeps exactly one log open.
decision/private-diagnostics-files · Owner-only diagnostics files — The diagnostics directory is 0700 and each diagnostics file 0600, opened without following symlinks; before the first write each must be owned by the effective user, have no group or other bits and not be a symlink, a failed check counting as a failed open. · why: A pre-existing foreign, permissive or symlinked diagnostics file is never written.
decision/strict-modes-before-diagnostics · Home strict-modes check before diagnostics — Nothing under the home, the diagnostics directory included, is created or opened before the role's strict-modes check on the home passes; a refused home gets no diagnostics line.
contract/cli-exit-codes/21 · CLI exit codes · 21 — An instance strict-modes refusal exits 21 with the fixed instance-state pair, or under --json the document {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}.
decision/diagnostics-init-before-role-work · Diagnostics init before the role's work — Diagnostics init and the process-start line come before the role's work: in run before its collision check and the child spawn, in mcp before its stdio transport starts. · why: Exit-1 causes are logged.
decision/hook-single-log-open · One config read and one log open per hook — A hook invocation makes one config.json read and exactly one log open, then only appends. · guard: SPINE_BOUND
decision/instance-source-per-role · Instance source fixed per role — run takes its own name argument, never an inherited VIOLA_NAME; hook and mcp take VIOLA_NAME only; cli verbs that act on an instance (send, wait, last, answer, pause, release, link, unlink) take the target argument; list, verify, plugin install and revive --list take the caller's VIOLA_NAME only. · why: A wrapper never writes into another instance's run log.
decision/panic-hook-first · Panic hook installed first — The panic hook is installed as the first statement of main and writes only to the diagnostics file once that is open, never falling back to stderr.
