## 1-a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin a11y-scope-summary
decision/critical-path-dialog-answer · Critical path: dialog pending, then answer — A pending dialog answered with viola answer (question, permission, plan), including the unverified-cli refusal that withholds answers, is a must-be-accessible critical path.
decision/critical-path-send-readback · Critical path: confirmed send and readback — Confirmed send and readback, or refusal, through the viola send readback mirror [RB] is a must-be-accessible critical path.
decision/no-assertions-for-internal-crates · Internal crates not assertable — The internal crates of the modular monolith are not-assertable and carry no assertions. · why: library-only, with no UI surface
decision/no-assertions-for-plugin-and-ipc · Plugin and IPC channel not assertable — The Claude Code plugin hooks, the stdio MCP server and the wrapper IPC channel are not-assertable and carry no assertions. · why: ipc-internal with no UI surface, machine-to-machine traffic only
decision/tui-boundary-assertions-only · TUI boundary assertions only — The tui is asserted only at its boundary, through the portable-pty outer-PTY driver; the result is a boundary guarantee, never a conformance claim.
contract/cli-refusal/format · CLI refusals · refusal format — A refusal is written to stderr as unable … hint:, giving the reason and detail in text, with a typed exit code.
contract/tui-passthrough/focus-mouse-resize-sequences · viola run TUI passthrough · focus, mouse and resize sequences — Focus, mouse and resize sequences and terminal replies pass through and do not count as human editing for wheel purposes.
contract/tui-passthrough/run-diagnostics · viola run TUI passthrough · run diagnostics — viola's diagnostics for run go to diagnostics/, never to the terminal.
contract/tui-passthrough/vendor-content · viola run TUI passthrough · vendor content — The rendered content belongs to the vendor claude and is not traced; viola parses it through a vt100 feed, and no conformance claim is made about the claude TUI.
contract/tui-passthrough/viola-terminal-bytes · viola run TUI passthrough · viola terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes of its own to the terminal; only the child's output reaches it.
contract/viola-revive-json/start-refusal · viola revive --json output · start refusal — Every refusal of the start that revive shares with run prints one exit-1 document, pinned-hash-mismatch and squatted-name among them, and a program not found as internal-error.
decision/critical-path-human-takes-wheel · Critical path: human takes the wheel — The human taking the wheel in the tui, automation refused (send refused with human-typing) and release returning it, with pause and release on the cli, is a must-be-accessible critical path.
decision/no-a11y-tool-output-discipline-assertions · Output-discipline assertions instead of an a11y tool — cli and tui use no a11y tool: the existing process, literal-pin and portable-pty output-discipline assertions on text and streams stand in, with manual screen-reader passes as a supplement. · why: no automated a11y tool reaches a terminal
decision/output-discipline-stands-in-for-sc · Output discipline stands in for WCAG SC — Output-discipline assertions stand in for SC 1.3.2, 1.4.1 and 3.3.1: meaningful linear order, colour never the sole cue, and the refusal reason and detail given in text. · why: WCAG does not apply directly to terminal output
contract/tui-passthrough/entry · viola run TUI passthrough · entry — The passthrough is entered by viola run and by a viola revive whose preflight passed.

## a11y-scope-summary · ## 1. A11y Scope Summary · twin 1-a11y-scope-summary
decision/run-diagnostics-off-terminal · Run diagnostics never reach the terminal — viola's diagnostics for `run` go to `diagnostics/`, never to the terminal.
contract/cli-json-failure/document · CLI --json failures · failure document — Each CLI failure under `--json` is one document, a literal exit, empty stderr, no ESC byte and a body holding no path or upstream text.
contract/frame-verb-refusal/strict-modes-failed · frame verb refusals · strict-modes-failed — send, wait, last, answer, pause and release refuse an instance failing the strict-modes check before any frame or log: exit 21, stdout empty, `hint:` last on stderr, or under `--json` `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}`; the mode is left as found.
contract/link-unlink/exit-20 · viola link and viola unlink · exit 20 — A pair the wrapper refuses as invalid params reaches `viola link` or `viola unlink` as a fault: exit 20, no hint.
contract/link-unlink/exit-21 · viola link and viola unlink · exit 21 — `viola link` and `viola unlink` refuse with exit 21 a driven instance that fails the strict-modes check (before any log opens), a stopped driven instance, and a server that is not the recorded wrapper.
contract/revive-json-refusal/document · viola revive --json refusals · exit-1 refusal document — Each exit-1 refusal of the strict-modes check, the preflight or the start shared with `run` is one document `{"v":1,"error":"<code>","detail":null}` on stdout with empty stderr.
contract/revive-json-refusal/strict-modes-failed · viola revive --json refusals · strict-modes-failed — One of the closed set of `error` codes a `viola revive --json` exit-1 refusal document carries.
contract/start-refusal/home-strict-modes · viola run, revive start and verify refusals · home strict-modes failure — Over a home tree failing the strict-modes check, `viola run`, a `viola revive` start and `viola verify` refuse before any log opens: exit 1, stdout empty, the home-state pair on stderr with `hint:` last, no child; `verify` prints no step line and no summary.
contract/start-refusal/socket-dir · viola run, revive start and verify refusals · socket directory failure — Over a failing socket directory, `viola run` and a `viola revive` start refuse with exit 1 before any snapshot, bind or child: the socket-directory pair on stderr, `hint:` last, plain ASCII, no SGR, naming only the parsed name; the directory is left as found.
contract/tui-passthrough/own-bytes · TUI passthrough · terminal bytes — viola writes zero bytes to the terminal except the child's output; a passed `viola revive` writes no line of its own while the child holds the terminal.
decision/linux-only · Linux only — Every surface targets Linux only: the core on any current distribution, its CI on `ubuntu-latest`, and the 0.2.0 window features on Hyprland.
decision/output-discipline-a11y-fallback · Output-discipline assertions stand in for a11y tools — CLI a11y is checked by output-discipline assertions on the existing CLI drivers (process Command, literal-pinned strings, SGR-only checks through the portable-pty outer PTY), their results machine-parseable through the harness `run` JSON. · why: no automated a11y tool exists for terminal output; a11y tools assume a DOM or native widget tree
contract/cli-json-failure/send-answer-exit-2 · CLI --json failures · send and answer exit 2 — The `viola answer` and `viola send` exit-2 paths write a fixed stderr line and no document.
contract/frame-verb-refusal/server-verify-failed · frame verb refusals · server-verify-failed — send, wait, last, answer, pause, release, link and unlink refuse before any frame a server that is not the recorded wrapper: exit 21, stdout empty, the server-verify `hint:` last on stderr; under `--json` that `error` `instance-unreachable` document, stderr empty.
contract/frame-verb-refusal/socket-dir-refused · frame verb refusals · socket-dir-refused — Frame verbs refuse a failing socket directory before any frame: exit 21, socket-directory `hint:` last on stderr, plain ASCII, no path, pid or uid; under `--json` `error` `instance-unreachable`, `detail` `socket-dir-refused`; the directory is left as found.
contract/hook-call/strict-modes-failed · viola hook event and dialog calls · strict-modes failure — A hook call refused by the strict-modes check returns exit 0 at once, empty stdout and stderr, under 1.0 s, with no `config.json` read, no stdin read, no frame, no line and no SessionEnd append; a `VIOLA_DIR` naming no instance directory writes nothing.
contract/interrupted-verify/stderr · viola verify interrupted · stderr lines — A `verify` stopped by Ctrl-C or TERM before its rows are checked prints no step line and no summary, only `unable: verify was stopped before it finished` and `hint: run viola verify again to stamp this CLI` last on stderr, plain ASCII.
contract/mcp-frame-tool/strict-modes-failed · MCP server frame tools · strict-modes-failed — An MCP frame tool against an instance failing the strict-modes check returns `isError` with code `instance-unreachable`, `detail` `strict-modes-failed`, sends no frame and writes no line.
contract/plugin-install/exit-21 · viola plugin install · exit 21 — The exit-21 refusal of `viola plugin install` is the home pair with `hint:` last and stdout empty, or under `--json` `{"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"strict-modes-failed"}` with stderr empty.
contract/revive-human-refusal/pair · viola revive human refusals · unable/hint pair — Without `--json`, each exit-1 refusal of `viola revive` is one `unable:` line and one `hint:` line last on stderr, byte-identical.
contract/revive-json-refusal/internal-error · viola revive --json refusals · internal-error — One of the closed set of `error` codes a `viola revive --json` exit-1 refusal document carries; a `claude` not found at a start reads as this document and has no human pair.
contract/revive-json-refusal/socket-dir-refused · viola revive --json refusals · socket-dir-refused — One exit-1 document with `socket-dir-refused` its code on stdout, in place of the human pair, before any snapshot, bind or child spawn, holding no path, pid or uid, with stderr empty and no hint.
contract/tui-passthrough/after-feed-panic · TUI passthrough · after a contained vt100 feed panic — The driver's `send` is refused `not-delivered` / `input-not-ready` (exit 13) while a typed human key still reaches the child; none of `panic`, `parse-rejected`, `vt100`, `unable` or `hint:` reaches the outer terminal, and the child's own bytes do.

## 2-a11y-strategy · ## 2. A11y Strategy
contract/cli-refusal/hint-line · CLI refusal output · hint line — A refusal ends with `hint:` as the last stderr line, carrying a recovery instruction where recovery exists.
contract/cli-refusal/unable-line · CLI refusal output · unable line — A refusal prints `unable  <name>  <reason>  <detail>` on stderr, the plain word followed by plain detail; `viola revive`'s exit-1 refusals, `viola run`'s socket-directory refusal and `viola verify`'s interrupted pair print one `unable: <text>` line instead.

## 4-aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin aria-patterns-roles
decision/portable-pty-outer-pty-driver · portable-pty as the outer-PTY boundary driver — The tui boundary assertions run on the portable-pty `=0.9.0` outer-PTY driver, checking that viola emits zero terminal bytes of its own and that human keystrokes are never blocked or delayed.
decision/wheel-ignores-terminal-events · Focus, mouse and resize never move the wheel — On the tui, focus, mouse and resize sequences do not move the wheel, and viola originates zero bytes on the human's terminal. · guard: outer-PTY nextest cases on ubuntu-latest
decision/cli-output-discipline-assertion-tools · CLI assertable as output discipline — The cli is assertable as output discipline, with no conformance claim, by `std::process::Command` with literal pins and portable-pty outer-PTY SGR checks on the `ubuntu-latest` CI leg.
decision/send-refused-while-human-typing · Send refused while the human types — When the human takes the wheel, `send` is refused with `human-typing` on stderr and a typed exit code. · guard: std::process::Command asserts
decision/tui-boundary-only · Tui accessibility is boundary-only — The tui is the vendor `claude` TUI, and viola's accessibility work on it is held only at its boundary, with no landmarks of its own.

## aria-patterns-roles · ## 4. ARIA Patterns & Roles · twin 4-aria-patterns-roles
decision/sgr-beside-its-word · SGR only beside its word — Every SGR span sits beside its word: amber only on DIALOG, dim only on stale rows, bold only on NAME column values; unable and fail are never coloured. · guard: cross_list_rows_style_each_span_beside_its_word_on_a_terminal

## 6-visual-design-verification · ## 6. Visual Design Verification · twin visual-design-verification
decision/unable-fail-never-coloured · Refusal and failure words never coloured — The words `unable` and `fail` are never coloured.

## 8-cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin cognitive-accessibility
decision/fixed-cli-strings-pinned · Fixed CLI strings pinned by literal — Every fixed CLI string, hints and result lines included, is pinned by literal. · why: so any copy change fails CI until the pinned string is updated on purpose
decision/fixed-copy-from-design · Fixed CLI copy comes from design — The CLI's fixed copy set (`no wrapped sessions  start one: viola run <name> -- claude`, `unknown`, `n/a`) comes from design.
decision/reason-code-beside-unable · Reason codes always beside unable — Every kebab-case reason or detail code (`not-delivered`, `human-typing`, `unverified-cli`) always sits beside the plain word `unable`.
decision/refusal-layout-literal-pins · Refusal layout held by literal pins — Each refusal's `unable <reason> <detail>` plus final `hint:` layout, its typed exit code and a hint-free `--json` are held by literal asserts in CI on ubuntu-latest. · guard: literal pins over std::process::Command on ubuntu-latest
contract/cli-refusal/fault · CLI refusal output · fault — Faults are not refusals and carry no hint.
contract/cli-refusal/json · CLI refusal output · --json — Under `--json` a refusal gives one document with no hint, except the `viola answer` and `viola send` exit-2 paths, which print a fixed stderr line and no document.
contract/cli-refusal/unknown-refusal · CLI refusal output · the `unknown` refusal — The `unknown` refusal exits 14 and is the one refusal with no hint; its detail is a code word or nothing.

## cognitive-accessibility · ## 8. Cognitive Accessibility · twin 8-cognitive-accessibility
decision/error-bodies-have-writer-and-witness · Error bodies have a writer and a witness — Each error body names a writer and a witness that stand, and each product error writer is named. · guard: error_bodies_each_name_a_writer_and_a_witness_that_stand
decision/error-word-detail-hint · Errors as word, detail and hint — Every error is a printed word followed by plain detail, and a recovery instruction where recovery exists.
decision/faults-carry-no-hint · Faults carry no hint — Faults (error: wrapper fault, error: internal error) are not refusals and carry no hint.
decision/fixed-cli-strings-pinned-by-literal · Fixed CLI strings pinned by literal — Every fixed CLI string is pinned by a literal in a test, so any copy change fails CI until the pinned string is updated on purpose.
decision/json-failure-documents-are-clean · --json failure documents are clean — Each --json failure is one document with a literal exit, empty stderr, no ESC byte and a body holding no path or upstream text. · guard: cli_error_documents_hold_no_path_or_upstream_text
decision/json-one-document-no-hint · One --json document with no hint — Under --json a failure gives one document with no hint. · except: the viola answer and viola send exit-2 paths write a fixed line to stderr whatever --json says, and no document
decision/no-hint-names-release · No hint names release — No hint names the release verb. · guard: no_hint_names_release
decision/one-hint-per-code · One hint per code — No two codes share a hint. · guard: no_two_codes_share_a_hint
decision/printed-names-are-parsed-arguments · Printed names are the parsed arguments — Names printed in hints and in link result lines are the verb's own parsed ViolaName arguments, never names read back from a reply or the log.
decision/strict-modes-refusal-before-any-write · Strict-modes refusal before any write — A home or instance failing the strict-modes check is refused first, before any log opens, frame is sent or child starts, with no line written: exit 21 for frame verbs and link/unlink, exit 1 for run, revive's start and verify.
decision/unknown-refusal-has-no-hint · unknown refusal carries no hint — The unknown refusal prints no hint. · why: its detail is a code word or nothing, opaque to a reader, so no hint is printed rather than a guess
decision/unstattable-home-is-strict-modes-refusal · Unstattable home is a strict-modes refusal — A home path under a regular file is a strict-modes refusal with its hint: verify gives the home-state pair with exit 1, the frame verbs the instance-state pair with exit 21.
contract/cli-exit-codes/21 · CLI exit codes · 21 — instance-unreachable: the frame verb was refused before reaching the instance, the cause in detail.
contract/cli-fixed-message/form · CLI fixed-message refusal · form — viola revive's exit-1 refusals and viola run's socket-directory refusal print one unable: <text> line, then one hint: line last.
contract/cli-refusal/stderr-layout · CLI refusal · stderr layout — unable  <reason>  <detail> on stderr, then hint: as the last stderr line, with a typed exit code.
contract/instance-unreachable-detail/strict-modes-failed · instance-unreachable detail · strict-modes-failed — The instance failed the strict-modes check; refused before any frame or log, no log line written.
contract/instance-unreachable-detail/unwrapped-name · instance-unreachable detail · unwrapped-name — The name has no live endpoint and no instance directory (absent, a regular file or a symlink).
contract/instance-unreachable-json/document · exit 21 under --json · document — One {"v":1,"error":"instance-unreachable","detail":"<cause>"} document on stdout per cause, stderr empty, no hint and no ESC.
contract/start-json-refusal/document · run / revive start under --json · refusal document — Every refusal of the start revive shares with run gives one {"v":1,"error":"<code>","detail":null} document with no hint and empty stderr.
decision/peer-replies-screened-to-code-words · Peer replies screened to code words — A peer's refusal that is no code word reads unknown, and a string detail that is no code word reads nothing (null under --json and on MCP).
decision/unlisted-code-words-stay-visible · Unlisted code words stay visible — A code word outside the closed refusal list is shown in the document and in refused: <word>, and takes unknown's exit 14. · why: visible by design
contract/cli-exit-codes/11 · CLI exit codes · 11 — budget-paused, with detail five-hour or seven-day.
contract/cli-exit-codes/13 · CLI exit codes · 13 — An answer for an expired or absent dialog is refused not-delivered / unknown-dialog.
contract/cli-exit-codes/14 · CLI exit codes · 14 — unknown: a refusal whose word is outside the closed refusal list.
contract/cli-exit-codes/2 · CLI exit codes · 2 — A usage error, or an unusable answer response or send text written as one fixed stderr line with no document.
contract/cli-exit-codes/20 · CLI exit codes · 20 — A fault, with no hint.
contract/human-fault-line/wrapper-fault · human fault line · wrapper fault — error: wrapper fault  <code>.
contract/json-fault/internal-error · CLI fault under --json · internal-error — Where a verb prints error: internal error, --json prints the internal-error document with null detail on stdout instead, stderr empty; run, revive's start, mcp and hook stay silent there.

## 11-a11y-anti-patterns-never-do-these · ## 11. A11y Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
decision/codes-beside-plain-word · Kebab-case codes beside a plain word — A kebab-case reason or detail code (`not-delivered`, `human-typing`, `unverified-cli`) on a refusal line never appears without the plain word `unable`; the board's cells show status codes such as `unverified-cli` without it. · why: no jargon without a plain alternative; SC 3.1.5 AAA is not claimed
decision/non-editing-sequences · Terminal sequences are not human editing — Focus, mouse and resize sequences and terminal replies (the F-W2 closed list) pass through and never count as human editing; every other byte does (P4).
decision/refusal-ends-with-hint · Every refusal ends with a hint — Every human-mode CLI refusal ends with a `hint:` recovery line (SC 3.3.3). · except: `unknown` (exit 14), whose detail is a code word or nothing
decision/no-colour-on-failure-words · Failure words are never coloured — The CLI words `unable` and `fail` are never coloured.
decision/no-screen-content-parsing · No screen-content parsing beyond signatures — The rendered `claude` TUI screen is parsed only for compiled signatures (footer literals, the input box's rule and prompt rows, modal literals), the prompt row only for its opening char, never the text after it; screenshots are never taken as a11y evidence (R7). · why: the rendered TUI is vendor content

## a11y-testing-tool-pick · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/cli-a11y-by-literal-tests · CLI a11y checked by literal tests — With no a11y tool for terminal output, output discipline is checked by tests that drive the viola binary as a process and pin each fixed string by a literal.
decision/tui-boundary-driver-pin · TUI boundary driver — The tui boundary is driven by a portable-pty outer PTY on the workspace's exact =0.9.0 pin, which a11y inherits as-is and never re-pins.

## keyboard-test-harness · key of ## 3. A11y Assertion Harness Contract
decision/boundary-check-never-inspects-claude-content · Boundary check never inspects claude content — The keyboard boundary check never inspects claude content.
decision/boundary-tests-sequenced-on-records · Boundary tests sequenced on records — The keyboard boundary cases are sequenced on log records, never on a timer, and each boundary clause is its own nextest case.
decision/zero-viola-bytes-on-the-terminal · Zero viola bytes on the terminal — The outer-PTY stream holds no viola-originated bytes (no message literals, hint:, SGR or cursor control the child did not emit), compared byte for byte with an unwrapped run.
decision/statusline-output-passed-byte-for-byte · Statusline output passed byte for byte — viola hook statusline hands the user's own status line output to the child byte for byte and writes nothing to the terminal itself. · guard: passthrough_with_a_statusline_source_adds_no_viola_bytes
decision/stdin-classifier-non-editing-list · Closed non-editing stdin list — Only focus reports, mouse reports and terminal replies matched by exact grammar leave the wheel alone; every other byte, including a sequence one field or prefix away from a listed shape, takes the wheel. · why: ratified, the exact grammars chosen after a narrower option was shown
