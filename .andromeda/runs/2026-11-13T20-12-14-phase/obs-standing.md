- S1 · each new or changed integration test that drives viola keeps its test home under the one scanned root, kept until the gates run · ci-integration · 9-ci-integration
  decision/homes-kept-until-gates-run · Test homes kept until the gates run — Integration-test homes are kept until the gate steps have run.
  decision/test-homes-kept-until-gates · Test homes kept until gate steps run — CI sets AGENT_RUN_KEEP_HOMES=1 so no home is deleted before G2, G4, the secret scan and the uploads have read it. · why: otherwise a green run leaves target/e2e-home/ empty, G2's non-empty check fails, and nothing is scanned
  decision/test-homes-under-e2e-home · Integration-test homes under one root — Every integration-test viola home lives under target/e2e-home, so the panic gate, schema gate, secret scan and diagnostics upload all cover it. · why: a hook panic exits 0, so a home outside that root would hide it · except: the one chaos_feed_panic test home
  decision/test-homes-under-scan-root · Test homes live under the scanned root — Every viola home of integration and E2E tests lives under target/e2e-home/, so G2, G4, the secret scan and the diagnostics upload cover it. · why: a hook panic exits 0, so a home outside that root would hide it · except: tests/chaos_feed_panic.rs keeps its one home outside the scan root, and asserts its deliberate panic and parse-rejected lines present itself
- S2 · each OS-gated test joins the OS-gated test census · ci-integration
- S3 · emitted diagnostics lines in each integration test are schema-checked against the line schema · ci-integration
  contract/process-log-line/at-instants · the process log line · *_at — Instants are named *_at and written in RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds and a Z suffix.
  contract/process-log-line/duration-ms · the process log line · duration_ms — Durations are duration_ms as an integer.
  contract/process-log-line/event · the process log line · event — The event field is a closed kebab-case enum; a new value needs a Decisions Log entry, and each value fixes what its corr holds.
  contract/process-log-line/field-names · the process log line · field names — Field names are snake_case.
  contract/process-start-event/service-name · the process-start event · service_name — Emitted once per process as the fixed value "viola", the binary name.
  contract/process-start-event/version · the process-start event · version — Emitted once per process as the crate package version.
  decision/diag-lines-schema-checked-in-unit-tests · Emitted lines schema-checked in integration and E2E tests — Emitted role lines are checked against schemas/diag-line.v1.json by integration tests and the E2E schema_check over real process output; unit tests check only detail lines, against schemas/diag-detail.v1.json.
  decision/schema-conformance-gate · Schema conformance gate on real process output — Every role-file line of test homes must validate against schemas/diag-line.v1.json and every detail line against schemas/diag-detail.v1.json; a failing line fails the build, a torn non-JSON line is skipped and counted. · why: schema failures count as a build failure and unit tests check only in-memory lines · guard: gate G4 (schema-conformance step)
- S4 · a test waits on a log line by reading for it, never by sleeping · 10-slo-invariants-telemetry-budgets
  decision/no-sleep-based-log-waits · No sleep-based log waits — No log-based wait relies on sleeps.
