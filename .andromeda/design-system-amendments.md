## 2026-09-27-browser-verdict-reachability — render and contrast judged on the ubuntu leg while the browser runs on three OSes
**Section:** §Typography (the per-OS fallback rationale; "Assertions hold on the Linux fallback") · §Surface: web-spa → Platform-Specific Notes (Fonts: "Linux is the CI render")
**Change:** the headless GUI checks' render and contrast verdicts are judged on the ubuntu leg (was "the headless GUI checks run on ubuntu"); the browser suite itself runs on all three CI OSes, where those assertions are not the verdict. Linux stays the CI render, with DejaVu Sans Condensed + DejaVu Sans Mono resolved.
**Why:** founder ruling W125 put the browser pipe on all three CI OSes (chunk 2026-09-27-browser-verdict-reachability); the font stacks and the DejaVu requirement are unchanged.
**Kept:** the "the CI render" labels in the font table and the token comment, and the 2026-09-24 Decisions Log line, stand as written.
